    "content": "<p><strong>Priests</strong> were people who worked in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186483\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">temple</span> of God in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186523\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. Before people built the temple, priests worked in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186793\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">tabernacle</span>, which was a portable temple, a tent. The temple, and before that the tabernacle, was the place where the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186562\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israelite</span> people worshiped God. Priests were responsible for offering <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186559\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> to God on behalf of the people. They took care of the temple and taught the people how to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186483\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">worship</span> God.</p><p>God is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186506\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">holy</span>, and people cannot just come to him, because people are <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sinful</span>. Because people are sinful, they are <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186615\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">unclean</span>. In the Bible, to be unclean means to be unfit to come before God. People have to become clean first. The work of the priests was to make people clean-to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186815\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">purify</span> them. The priests did this by offering <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186559\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> on behalf of the people, and by teaching people how to live. They performed rituals that symbolized that people became clean. The priests therefore were in between God and the people. They made it possible for people to come before God and continue to have a good <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm108\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">relationship</span> with God. They purified the people, so that God was able to come down and meet the people. Priests were very important people for the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jews</span>. Because people stayed sinful, the priests had to often make sacrifices and purify the people again and again.</p><p>Only certain people could become a priest. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186562\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israelites</span> were divided into 12 tribes. One tribe was called the tribe of Levi, and the people in this tribe were called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186797\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Levites</span>. Moses, through whom God gave the people his law, was a Levite. And Moses&apos;s brother Aaron was also a Levite. Aaron became the first <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186494\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">high priest</span> of the Jews. A high priest is the most important priest. God made Aaron&apos;s sons the first priests. From that time onwards, all Aaron&apos;s male <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm234\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">descendants</span> became priests.</p><p>There were also Levites who were not descendants of Aaron. These people also became important. They helped the priests in their duty. The Bible often talks about &quot;priests and Levites.&quot; The priests are mentioned separately because they were more important, even though priests themselves are also descendants from Levi.</p><p>In the time of Jesus, some priests were also leaders of the people. They are called chief priests. These chief or leading priests were often wealthy people who were related to the high priest. They often belonged to the group of religious leaders called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186639\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Sadducees</span> and were part of the Jewish council, named the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186557\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Sanhedrin</span>. The chief priests often argued with Jesus.</p><p>The people who lived in the countries surrounding Israel also had people who were in between the people and their gods. The Bible also calls these people priests, but they were very different from the Jewish priests.</p><p><strong>When you are translating priest, be careful about the following things:</strong></p><p>Your language may have a word that means someone who offers sacrifices to God. This might be a good word for the biblical word for priest. Maybe you need to make a small change, like saying &quot;a priest of God.&quot; But be careful that people will not get confused. Maybe the things that a &quot;priest&quot; in your community does are too different from what a priest in the Bible does. Maybe you need to make up a new word or phrase, like &quot;someone who offers sacrifices to God,&quot; or &quot;a sacrificer,&quot; or &quot;a man who works in the temple of God.&quot; But remember that you also need to have a word for a Levite. A Levite can be a &quot;helper of a priest,&quot; a &quot;helper in the temple,&quot; or a &quot;descendant of Levi who helps in the temple.&quot;</p><p>Some <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm175\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christian</span> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm24\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">churches</span> use the word &quot;priest&quot; for a leader in the church. It is not a good idea to use this same word for &quot;priests&quot; in the Bible, because the meaning is quite different. A leader in the church does not offer sacrifices like the priests in the Bible did.</p><p>Remember that you also need a word for chief priests-the most important priests-and for the high priest, who is the most important priest of all.</p>",
