At that time, the place was called Mamre, but people also knew it as Kiriath-arba. First Sarah, and later Abraham as well, died and were buried in this place. Their son Isaac, his wife Rebecca, and their son Jacob and his wife Leah were also buried there.</p><p>Much later, during the time when Joshua was leading the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186562\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israelites</span> to conquer the land, the Israelites attacked Hebron and conquered it from the Canaanites who were living there.</p><p>Again much later, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186466\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">David</span> became <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186796\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">king</span> over the people of Judah while living in Hebron. After several years, David moved to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186523\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. From that time onwards, the city of Jerusalem became the most important city for the Israelites, and we don&apos;t hear much more about Hebron.</p>",
