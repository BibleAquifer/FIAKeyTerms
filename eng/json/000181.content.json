The Roman government had appointed these rulers, and so Herodians were also supportive of the Roman government. In this way they were the opposites of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186507\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Pharisees</span>, the group of religious teachers who were against Roman rule. However, the Pharisees and the Herodians worked together against Jesus.</p>",
