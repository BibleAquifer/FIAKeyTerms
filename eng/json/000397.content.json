People can make vows to show that they are devoted to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186808\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">God</span>. God does not require people to make vows. But, if a person makes a vow, the vow is seriously binding like an <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186516\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">oath</span>. God releases the person from the vow once he has done what he vowed to do.</p><p>Jacob asked God to bring him back to the land of his father, and if God would do this, then Jacob would worship God. Jacob was making a vow.</p><p>Hannah asked God to give her a son, and promised that if God would do so, Hannah would give the son back to God to serve him. Hannah was making a vow.</p>",
