    "content": "<p><strong>Abba</strong> is the Aramaic word for &quot;father.&quot; Aramaic was the language that the people in Israel spoke in Jesus&apos;s time. Jesus calls God &quot;abba&quot; when he prays to God just before he was arrested and then <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186549\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">crucified</span>. Paul later wrote in his letters that the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186642\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> makes us say &quot;abba, father!&quot; to God. This means that because of the Holy Spirit, we can have the same intimate relationship with God as a child has with its father-just as Jesus had.</p>",

Abraham&apos;s name had been Abram, but God later changed his name to Abraham. Abraham means &quot;the father of many nations.&quot;</p><p>Abraham lived about two thousand years before the birth of Jesus. He first lived in a region named Ur, which was somewhere east of Israel. Abraham&apos;s father Terah took his sons and their wives with him and left Ur, because he wanted to go to the country named <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186792\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Canaan</span>, but he stopped in a place called Haran. This was still quite far away from Canaan. The family began to live there, and after some time Abraham&apos;s father died. Abraham and his family did not know God; they worshiped <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186800\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">idols</span>.</p><p>When Abraham was 75 years old, God spoke to him. God told him to leave behind his homeland, and to go to a place that God would show him. God said that he would <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186619\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">bless</span> Abraham, that he would make a great <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186495\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">nation</span> out of him, and that God would bless all the nations of the world through Abraham. And Abraham obeyed God! Together with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot he set out on a long journey. When he came to Canaan, God told him that this was the country that he would give to Abraham and to his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm234\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">descendants</span>.</p><p>However, Abraham did not have any descendants yet. He had no children, and he was already an old man! But he believed God&apos;s promise. And God was very pleased with Abraham&apos;s trust, and therefore he accepted Abraham as someone with whom God could have a good relationship.</p><p>But Abraham still had to wait for a long time before God gave him any descendants. He had to wait 25 more years, and during that time he made several mistakes and sometimes forgot to trust God. But eventually, when Abraham was 100 years old and his wife Sarah was 90 years old, Sarah gave birth to a son. How happy Abraham and Sarah were then! And they called their son &quot;Isaac,&quot; which means laughter.</p><p>Then, after some years, God gave Abraham a very difficult test. God told Abraham that he had to sacrifice his son Isaac. He had to kill Isaac, and burn him as a gift for God! But by now Abraham had really learned to trust God, and he obeyed. And when Abraham had already lifted his knife to kill his son, God stopped him and praised Abraham! And God said that because Abraham had shown that he really trusted God and had obeyed him, now the blessing that God had promised to give to Abraham would continue also for Isaac, and Abraham&apos;s further generations. Through Abraham&apos;s descendants all the people of the world would be blessed!</p><p>And so, Isaac grew up and had two sons. The youngest son was Jacob. Jacob&apos;s name was later changed to Israel. Jacob, or Israel, had 12 sons. The descendants of these 12 sons became the 12 tribes of Israel. They became a big nation. And one of their descendants was Jesus! And through Jesus, all the people of the world are blessed. God has fulfilled his promise to Abraham!</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Adultery</strong> is a form of sexual <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sin</span>. God considers it a sin whenever people have a sexual relationship with someone to whom they are not married, but in the Old Testament the word adultery is used for a specific case. If a man has sexual relations with a woman who was married to someone else, both the man and woman are guilty of adultery. The punishment for adultery is death. However, if the woman is raped, only the man had to die.</p><p>When a man had sexual relations with an unmarried woman or <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186617\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">slave</span>, he had still disobeyed, or sinned, against God, but according to the Old Testament law, this sin is not in the category of adultery.</p><p>God hates adultery and every form of sexual sin. God often compares the disobedience of people to himself with adultery: When people are unfaithful to God and begin to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186472\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">worship</span> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186800\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">idols</span> and false gods, they are behaving just like a man and a woman who are unfaithful to their own husband or wife. Therefore, God calls idolatry-the worship of idols or of any other god besides God himself-a form of adultery.</p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus made the rules about adultery more strict. He said that if someone only <em>thought</em> about having a sexual relationship with someone they are not married to, this is already sin.</p>",

Often, the first thing they had to say to people was &quot;do not be afraid!&quot;</p><p>An angel can also do a specific task for God.

    "content": "<p>To <strong>anoint</strong> someone means to pour sweet smelling oil over someone. You can also anoint an object.</p><p>In the Old Testament, before God gave someone a special task, he would instruct someone else to pour oil over that person&apos;s head. The oil was a symbol for the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186642\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit of God</span>. This ritual made clear that God had set this person apart for a special purpose. It also made clear that God was giving this person special <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186527\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">authority</span>. The person was then called &quot;anointed.&quot; For instance, God told Samuel to anoint <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186466\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">David</span> as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186796\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">king</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186627\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israel</span>. God told Moses to anoint Aaron as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186494\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">high priest</span>. And God told the prophet <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186548\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Elijah</span> to anoint Elisha as a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186511\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">prophet</span> to succeed Elijah.</p><p>Later, the word &quot;anointed&quot; was also used for people whom God had appointed for a special task, even if there had not been a ritual that involved the pouring of oil. Jesus is called &quot;the anointed,&quot; because God has selected him for a very special task.</p><p>People could also anoint objects. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186614\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">priests</span> anointed the objects that were used in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186483\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">temple</span> with oil to make clear that they now had a special purpose. These objects now belonged to God; they were sacred.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jewish</span> people also used anointing as a daily activity that had no special meaning. They used sweet smelling oil to take care of their skin and their hair. Jesus told the people that if they <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186513\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">fasted</span>, they should anoint themselves just as they did every day, rather than make themselves look unkempt so that other people could think, &quot;These people are fasting, how impressive!&quot;</p><p>People also put some oil on guests to show them they were welcome and honored. There are two stories in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186552\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Gospels</span> of women putting oil on Jesus&apos;s feet to honor him.</p><p>Jewish people also anointed a person&apos;s body after his death. After Jesus died, the women are bringing sweet smelling oil to the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186579\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">tomb</span> in order to anoint Jesus&apos;s body.</p><p>In the New Testament, the early <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm175\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christians</span> sometimes used oil together with <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186597\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">prayer</span> if someone was sick. The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186601\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">apostle</span> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186538\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">James</span>, in his letter, says that if someone is sick, the other <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm12\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">believers</span> should pray for the person and anoint the person with oil. This was not because the oil had any special power, but because it was a symbol of God&apos;s presence.</p>",
