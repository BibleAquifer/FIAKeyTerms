People sat on camels while traveling, and used camels to carry luggage. A camel has one or two humps on its back. Inside these humps, the camel stores fat which allows the camel to go for a long time without food or water. Once a camel has an opportunity to drink, it will drink an enormous amount of water at one time.</p><p>A camel was the largest animal that existed in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186627\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israel</span>.</p><p>People could make the short, stiff hair of a camel into cloth. This made simple and rough clothing. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186468\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">John the baptizer</span> wore clothes made from camel hair.</p><p><em>You can look in the video dictionary for a picture of a camel.</em></p>",
