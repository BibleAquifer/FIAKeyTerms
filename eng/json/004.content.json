    "content": "<p><strong>David</strong> was the second <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186796\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">king</span> of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186627\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israel</span>. He lived about 1000 years before the birth of Jesus.</p><p>David was the youngest son of a man named Jesse. David took care of his father&apos;s sheep. Jesse and his family lived in the village called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186547\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Bethlehem</span>. David&apos;s older brothers were soldiers in the army of King Saul, the first king of Israel. King Saul had been disobedient to God, and so God had rejected him. Because of that, God instructed the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186511\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">prophet</span> Samuel to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm5\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">anoint</span>-which means to appoint-David as the next king. But that was a secret at first, and Saul remained king for several more years. David became a commander in the king&apos;s army, and God helped him so that, through David, Israel could win many battles. David was very popular with the people, and his best friend was Jonathan, a son of King Saul. King Saul became jealous of David and tried to kill him several times, so David had to flee. David gathered a group of men around him and lived away from the people in the mountains. The king sometimes chased after David, and David, more than once, had an opportunity to kill the king, but he never did.</p><p>One time, when King Saul and his army were fighting with some enemies, the Israelites lost a battle and King Saul and his sons were killed. After this, the people of Israel made David their king. David began to live in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186523\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>, which became the most important city in Israel.</p><p>David became Israel&apos;s most beloved king. He loved God and trusted him. Therefore God called him a &quot;man after God&apos;s heart.&quot; David very much wanted to build a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186483\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">temple</span> for God, but God told David that not David, but David&apos;s son, would build this temple. And God gave David a very important promise. God promised David that one of his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm234\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">descendants</span> would always rule over Israel.</p><p>This does not mean that David never did anything wrong. In fact, he did some terrible things: He committed <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186521\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">adultery</span> and murder. But he repented of his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sins</span>, and God forgave him. But even though God <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186471\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">forgave</span> him, the effect of David&apos;s sins meant that that from that time onwards there was always quarreling and violence in his family, and several of his sons died. Some of David&apos;s sons tried to replace their father as king by force, and one time David had to flee from his own son!</p><p>When David became very old, he made his son Solomon king in his place.</p><p>Hundreds of years after David&apos;s death, the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186495\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">nation</span> of Israel no longer existed. The Israelites had been disobedient to God and, in order to punish them, God sent people from another country to conquer them. The Israelites were defeated and from that time onwards, they were ruled by other nations. No longer was there a descendant of David ruling over Israel. But God never forgets a promise, and so the people were waiting for God to again give them a descendant of David as king. God fulfilled this promise through Jesus.</p>",

A demon is a spirit that is rebelling against God. The leader of all demons is called <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186503\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Satan</span>, the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186519\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">devil</span>, or sometimes Beelzebul. Because God created everything that exists, God also created these spirits. God created them good, as <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186498\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">angels</span>, to do his work. But some angels rebelled against God, and these became evil spirits. These evil spirits try to destroy and deceive people.</p><p>Demons can take control of people so that people become sick or behave in a strange way. When a demon takes control of a person, we say that the person is &quot;<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186497\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">demon possessed</span>.&quot; A person who was possessed by a demon could become deaf, mute, or have fits that resemble epileptic attacks. The person could become very violent and shout. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jewish</span> people tried to drive out demons from people through rituals that could last a long time. But Jesus drove out many demons from people during his time on earth, and he did this only by commanding the demons to leave!</p><p>Demons can also be called evil spirits. This makes clear that their intentions are <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186491\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">evil</span>. They sometimes are called unclean spirits. Something that is <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186615\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">unclean</span> is unfit for service to God.</p><p><strong>When you are translating demon, be careful about the following things:</strong></p><p>Demons are not the spirits of humans who have died, though in many cultures they may pretend that this is what they are. If you have to use a term that means spirits of dead people, then be aware that the people will have to learn over time that these spirits are not really spirits of dead people, but are only pretending to be so.</p>",

People sometimes used divination to find out what the best time would be for a certain activity; for instance, to find out when to start an attack on another country.</p><p>There were different ways that people did divination. For example, some people would kill an animal and then look at the way that the organs of the animal were shaped. If the organ looked a certain way, then they thought that a certain thing would happen. If it looked different, then something else would happen. Or, people looked at the way that smoke moved when they burned something, and thought that different movements had different meanings. Other people looked at the stars and the planets in the sky and took meaning from their position.</p><p>God has forbidden his people to use divination. God&apos;s people do not need to use such rituals to find out what God wants! God tells people what he wants from them through his Scriptures and through messengers who speak God&apos;s messages, and God&apos;s people need to trust God for the future.</p>",

There are different types and sizes of doves. Some are white and others are speckled or have several colors. A dove is considered a gentle and peaceful bird. Doves can fly long distances, and they are very good at finding their way back to where they came from.</p><p>God required the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186562\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israelites</span> to offer animal <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186559\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> to him during different rituals. Usually these animals were sheep, goats, or bulls. For poor people these animals were too expensive. Therefore, God allowed people to sacrifice a pair of doves instead.</p><p>When Jesus was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186554\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">baptized</span>, the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186642\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> came down on him looking like a dove. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is a dove, only that at that time the Holy Spirit looked like a dove.</p>",
