The money that the person pays to free the prisoner or the slave is called a <strong>ransom</strong>.</p><p>The Bible says that Jesus gave his life as a ransom for people. This means that people are like prisoners or slaves, and that Jesus paid something to free the people. Jesus did not buy the people free with money, but with his own life, which is much more precious. Jesus&apos;s death was the price that Jesus paid to free the people from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sin</span> and shame and death.</p>",
