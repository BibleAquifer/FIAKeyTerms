    "content": "<p>Levites are people who belong to the tribe of Levi, one of the 12 tribes of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186627\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israel</span>.</p><p>The first ancestor of the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186562\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Israelites</span> was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186621\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Abraham</span>. Abraham&apos;s grandson, Jacob, had 12 sons. The descendants of these 12 sons became the 12 tribes of Israel. One of Jacob&apos;s son&apos;s names was Levi, and his descendants became known as the Levites, or the tribe of Levi.</p><p>Moses, through whom God gave the people his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186492\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">law</span>, was a Levite. And Moses&apos;s brother Aaron was also a Levite. Those Levites who were descendants of Aaron became <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186614\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">priests</span>. Priests were people who worked in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186483\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">temple</span> of God in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186523\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>. Before people built the temple, priests worked in the tabernacle-which was a portable temple, a tent. The temple, and before that the tabernacle, was the place where the Israelite people <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186472\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">worshiped</span> God. Priests were responsible for offering <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186559\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sacrifices</span> to God on behalf of the people. They took care of the temple and taught the people how to worship God. This was very important work. Other Levites who were not descendants of Aaron were also important, because they helped the priests in their duties. They also helped the priests take care of the tabernacle, and later, the temple.</p><p>The Bible often talks about &quot;priests and Levites.&quot; The priests are mentioned separately because they were more important, even though priests themselves are also Levites.</p>",
