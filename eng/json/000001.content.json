    "content": "<p><strong>Abba</strong> is the Aramaic word for &quot;father.&quot; Aramaic was the language that the people in Israel spoke in Jesus&apos;s time. Jesus calls God &quot;abba&quot; when he prays to God just before he was arrested and then <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186549\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">crucified</span>. Paul later wrote in his letters that the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186642\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> makes us say &quot;abba, father!&quot; to God. This means that because of the Holy Spirit, we can have the same intimate relationship with God as a child has with its father-just as Jesus had.</p>",
