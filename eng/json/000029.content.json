The name Bethlehem means &quot;house of bread.&quot; In the Old Testament, the events in the book of Ruth took place in Bethlehem. Ruth was a Moabite woman, so she was not an Israelite. Ruth&apos;s first husband had died, so Ruth came to live in Bethlehem with her Israelite mother-in-law. Later, Ruth married an Israelite man from Bethlehem. The great grandson of Ruth and her Israelite husband was <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186466\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">David</span>, who would later become the most beloved king of Israel.</p><p>Because king David was born in Bethlehem, Bethlehem is also called the city of David.</p><p>God later said through the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186511\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">prophet</span> Micah that another very important ruler would be born in Bethlehem. Therefore the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jews</span> were expecting that the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186575\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Messiah</span>, the special King and Savior that God had promised to send, would be born in Bethlehem.</p><p>God fulfilled this promise when Jesus was born in Bethlehem.</p><p>Bethlehem was a few kilometers away from <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186523\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jerusalem</span>, which was the most important city for the Jews.</p>",
