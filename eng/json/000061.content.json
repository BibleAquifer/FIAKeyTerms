    "content": "<p>Circumcision is the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jewish</span> custom of cutting off the loose skin at the end of a boy&apos;s penis. The father of the baby, or someone who was specially trained, usually did this. Circumcision happened when a baby boy was eight days old.</p><p>The custom began when God told <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186621\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Abraham</span> to circumcise himself and every male person in his <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186571\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">household</span>. The circumcision was a sign that the person was included in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186585\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">covenant</span> that God had made with Abraham. From that time onwards, every male Israelite had to be circumcised. If someone who was not a descendant of Abraham wanted to become part of the Israelites and a part of the covenant the Israelites had with God, he had to be circumcised as well. Men had to be circumcised in order to be acceptable for God.</p><p>The Bible also talks about &quot;circumcision of the heart.&quot; This is picture language for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186596\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">repenting</span> and for dedicating yourself to God. Only when people have repented, or turned away from their <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sins</span>, are they acceptable before God. The Israelites, or Jews, thought that they were better than all the other people in the world because they were circumcised. But God told them that being circumcised means nothing if people are not truly dedicated to God. Circumcision of the body is useless if the heart is not circumcised as well.</p><p>In the New Testament, the new believers in Jesus had different opinions about circumcision. Some Jewish Christians thought that all believers should be circumcised. They thought that only someone who was circumcised could really belong to God&apos;s people. Paul and the other apostles then taught the church that God no longer required circumcision of the body in order to belong to God&apos;s people. Instead, people need a spiritual circumcision of the heart: repentance, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186522\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">faith</span>, and obedience to Jesus.</p>",
