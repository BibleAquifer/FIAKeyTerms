Scriptures refers to the part of the Bible that we now call the Old Testament.</p><p>Teachers of the law explained the Scriptures to the people. They did not write down their explanations but told them to their students. Their students memorized their explanations, and taught these explanations to the next generation. People kept adding more and more explanations and discussions about explanations. In the time of the New Testament, these memorized explanations had become very important to the people, maybe even more important than the Scriptures themselves.</p><p>In the time of the New Testament, teachers of the law were very important people in the community. People showed them great respect and often called them &quot;<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186509\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Rabbi</span>,&quot; a title used for important religious teachers. There were also teachers of the law in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186557\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Sanhedrin</span>, the Jewish religious court.</p><p>Teachers of the law are sometimes called <strong>scribes</strong>. A scribe means someone who can write. Many people in the times of the Bible were not able to read or write themselves. If people needed to write something, like a letter, they would hire a scribe to write for them. Scribes also copied Scripture so that the text of the Scripture would not get lost. The Scriptures were not written down on paper, the way people do now. Books and paper did not yet exist. Instead, the people wrote Scriptures on long strips of papyrus or parchment. Papyrus is a thin sheet that is made from the fibers of a certain plant, and parchment is made from the skin of an animal. Because those sheets were very long, people rolled them up. The name for such a sheet is a scroll. Scrolls could become damaged quickly, especially those scrolls made of papyrus. Therefore scribes were always busy copying the text from one scroll to a new scroll, so that the text would not get lost.</p><p>However, when the Bible talks about teachers of the law, the focus is on their knowledge of the religious law, and not on their writing skills.</p><p><strong>When you are translating &quot;teachers of the law,&quot; be careful about the following things:</strong></p><p>You should not use a phrase that makes your listeners think that these people are teaching the law of a country. Maybe you can use a phrase like &quot;teachers of the religious law,&quot; or &quot;experts of the religious law,&quot; or &quot;experts of the Scriptures.&quot;</p>",
