People made the shelters from branches and leaves from a tree.</p><p>The <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186525\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Jews</span> celebrated a special festival once a year which they called the &quot;Feast of Shelters,&quot; or the &quot;<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm233\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Feast of Tabernacles</span> or tents.&quot; During this feast, the Jews made shelters or tents in their gardens or on the roof of their house and lived in these shelters for seven days. This reminded the people that a long time ago, in the time of Moses, God freed their ancestors from Egypt and they had wandered in the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186564\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">wilderness</span> for many years until they settled in the country that God had promised to give them. The shelters, or temporary homes, reminded the Jews that their ancestors had had no permanent place to stay during their years of wandering.</p>",
