    "content": "<p><strong>Divorce</strong> is a permanent and legal separation between a husband and wife. In the Old Testament, the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186492\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">law</span> of God allowed a man to divorce his wife if he thought she had a relationship with another man. However, God makes clear that he hates divorce. God wants husband and wife to live together in harmony and to be dedicated to each other.</p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus also teaches the people that divorce is wrong. God meant for husband and wife to live together in unity.</p>",
