    "content": "<p>The word <strong>gospel</strong> is a translation of a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186802\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Greek</span> word that literally means &quot;good news.&quot; The <strong>good news</strong> in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. In the New Testament, it becomes clear that the way that God saves his people is through Jesus&apos;s death and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186488\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">resurrection</span>. In Acts and in the epistles, when people are &quot;preaching the gospel,&quot; they are telling the people the good news that they can be saved if they trust in Jesus.</p><p>In the part of the Bible that talks about Jesus&apos;s life-the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-we also sometimes hear about the gospel, or about the &quot;good news of the kingdom.&quot; At that time, Jesus had not yet died to save the people. The good news here means that the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186541\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">kingdom of God</span> is about to begin, or has already begun. Jesus told the people that God was ruling over all the earth, and that soon God would establish his kingdom forever. Until that time, people should already behave as citizens of this kingdom, and prepare themselves to receive God. The good news is that God is ruling, and that even now we can already be members of his kingdom! After Jesus died to save us, people who trust in Jesus can be part of God&apos;s kingdom.</p><p>In the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm24\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">church</span>, we often use the term &quot;the Gospels&quot; to talk about the four books of the New Testament that tell us about the life of Jesus: the books Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. When talking about just one of these books, we often say &quot;the Gospel of Matthew,&quot; or &quot;the Gospel of Mark.&quot; This means that when we say for example &quot;the Gospel of Matthew,&quot; we mean the whole book of Matthew.</p>",
