    "content": "<p>A purification ceremony is a ritual that makes a person <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186615\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">clean</span>, which means fit for service to God. The words <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>unclean</strong> in the Bible are not talking about whether something is clean or dirty from the outside. In the Bible, a <em>clean</em> person means a person who is fit for service to God, who is acceptable to participate in <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186472\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">worship</span> to God. A person who is <em>unclean</em> is unfit for service to God, and cannot participate in public worship. Animals and even objects can also be clean or unclean.</p><p>If a woman was unclean because she had been bleeding during her monthly cycle or had given birth to a child, or if anyone had had sexual relations, had touched a dead body, or had recovered from a skin disease, they were unclean. They needed to wait a certain amount of time and then take a special bath. In some cases they also had to offer an animal <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186559\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sacrifice</span> to God. These activities together were called the purification ceremony. After this, these people were clean again and could participate in all worship activities.</p>",
