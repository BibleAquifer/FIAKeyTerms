    "content": "<p>When people live in harmony with each other without fighting, they are living in <strong>peace</strong>. But when the Bible talks about peace, this means much more than just the absence of fighting. It means that there is a lot of good!</p><p>When people live in peace, they are completely well. They have a complete life, and are living in harmony with each other, with nature, and most importantly, with God! Someone who lives in peace is content.</p><p>A community that has peace means that all the people in the community are content, and are living in harmony with each other and with God.</p><p>Because people are so disobedient to God, they could not live in peace with God. They became enemies of God. As a result of that, the people faced many difficulties and trouble. But because of Jesus&apos;s sacrifice, God made it possible again for people to have peace with God. When Jesus will come back, God&apos;s <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186550\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">kingdom</span> will be established and there will be peace. There will be complete harmony between God and people, between people and people, and between people and nature. Until that time, God&apos;s people are able to endure suffering and difficulties, because they know that they have peace with God.</p>",
