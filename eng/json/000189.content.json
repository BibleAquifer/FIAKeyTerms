    "content": "<p>In the Old Testament, the word <strong>Hosanna</strong> means &quot;save us.&quot; We can hear this word in Psalm 118. In this Psalm, the singer asks God to save the people, and then begins to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186543\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">praise</span> God. Because of that, by the time of the New Testament people used the word Hosanna as a way to praise God with great joy, because they trusted that God was going to <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186588\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">save</span> them soon. The practical meaning of the word Hosanna in the New Testament is therefore &quot;praise God.&quot;</p><p><strong>When you are translating Hosanna, be careful about the following things:</strong></p><p>You can translate Hosanna as &quot;praise God!&quot; Be sure that you make clear to your listeners that the people who are praising God with this word are very happy and excited.</p><p>Some translators choose to make up a word in their own language that sounds like &quot;Hosanna.&quot; If you want to do that, you may also want to say one time that this word means &quot;praise God.&quot;</p>",
