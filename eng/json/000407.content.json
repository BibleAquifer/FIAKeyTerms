    "content": "<p>When someone is wise, he has <strong>wisdom</strong>. In the Bible, a person who has wisdom understands many things, and is able to make good decisions that lead to good results. When a person has certain skills, like the ability to build or to make something beautiful, the Bible also says that this person has wisdom.</p><p>It is God who gives wisdom to people. If a person pretends to be wise but does not accept God, then his wisdom is useless, and eventually his plans will fail. Only a person who accepts and obeys God can be truly wise.</p><p>We can hear a lot about wisdom in the book of Proverbs. In this book, the author sometimes talks about wisdom as if it is a person. This is picture language that people used to help others learn about wisdom. And so, Proverbs can say that &quot;wisdom is calling out to people, trying to make people wise.&quot; Wisdom is calling just as a person would call. In 1 Corinthians, Paul talks about Jesus and calls Jesus the &quot;wisdom of God.&quot; God&apos;s plan to save the world through Jesus was very wise-and therefore, we can be sure that this plan will work!</p>",
