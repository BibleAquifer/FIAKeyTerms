Phoenicia was a narrow strip consisting of five cities on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>In the time of the New Testament this area belonged to the country named Syria. For that reason, someone who came from that area could be called a &quot;Syrian Phoenician.&quot; Many other people who lived in this area had come from other countries, especially Greece. A lot of people in this area were involved in trade-the buying and selling of goods, especially by means of ships.</p><p>Today, this area is part of the country we now know as Lebanon.</p>",
