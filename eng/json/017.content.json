    "content": "<p>The Bible uses earthly words to talk about heavenly things. Earthly words and heavenly things do not fit together perfectly, but they give us a helpful picture of God and what God does.</p><p>The Bible has several helpful ways of talking about how God <strong>redeems</strong>, or frees, his people.</p><p><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186617\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Slaves</span> must serve their masters. People who have debts must pay their debts. When you are redeeming a person, you are freeing that person from debt or slavery. This could involve paying a person&apos;s debt. The person who is freed is redeemed. Usually people redeem relatives or others they know. Sometimes a kind person who has enough money might redeem a stranger they feel sorry for.</p><p>Another example of redemption is that of a poor family who must sell their land for some reason. God had made a rule that land in Israel should always stay within the family. If a family was so poor that they had to sell a part of their land, then a relative should buy it from them if possible. That way, the land stayed in the family. We say that the relative &quot;redeemed&quot; the land. Sometimes a relative did not or could not buy or redeem the land. However, God had made a rule that in every 50th year-called the <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm276\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">year of Jubilee</span>-all the land had to go back to the original owners! That way, God made sure that no one would ever become too poor.</p><p>The Bible uses the picture of buying someone free to describe what God has done for people. In the Old Testament, God freed the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt. God did not pay the Egyptians anything in order to free the Israelites; God freed the Israelites because God is powerful and mighty. God described what he did for Israel by saying that He redeemed the people of Israel.</p><p>In the New Testament, we learn that God has redeemed us, or freed us, from slavery to sin. The idea of redemption, or God redeeming us, shows us what God has done. However, we should remember that God did not pay anyone anything for us. God does not need to pay someone something; he is powerful and mighty enough to save us. But God offered his son in our place, like one offers payment, to make us free from slavery to sin and evil. It is like God paid a very costly price for this: his own life, the life of Jesus. Because of this costly price, people can be free. God has redeemed us. We have received redemption. Redemption is a wonderful word that helps us understand God and what He has done when God redeemed us, or made us free.</p>",

Then have someone else come to them, and tell them that they should repent.</p><p>Act out that some of the people walking on the road realize the bad things that they have done, and they notice the dangerous place that they are walking towards. Act out that they are feeling really bad! Then act out that these people turn around, and begin to walk towards the good end of the road.

God is righteous, because everything that God does is right and good.</p><p>God wants all people to be righteous. Only a righteous person can have a good <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm108\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">relationship</span> with God.</p><p>The person who wants to obey God and wants to do things that pleases God is righteous, even though they may still make mistakes and unintentionally disobey God. A righteous person is sad when they discover that they have disobeyed God, and they repent. An unrighteous person on the other hand keeps doing bad things, and does not believe or care that God might get angry or punish them.</p><p>When <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186621\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Abraham</span> believed the promise that God gave him that Abraham would have many <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"keyTerm234\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">descendants</span>, God considered Abraham righteous. Abraham was not righteous because he had done a good thing, but simply because he trusted God.</p><p>This same kind of righteousness is available for people who believe in Jesus. When people trust in Jesus, God gives them the gift of righteousness. When you believe that you can have a right relationship with God because of what Jesus has done for you, God declares that you are righteous.</p><p><strong>When you are translating righteousness, be careful about the following things:</strong></p><p>You may describe righteousness as being in a right relationship with God, being right in God&apos;s sight, or being accepted by God. Or you may describe righteousness as being blameless or innocent, or being blameless or innocent in God&apos;s sight.</p><p>Your language may have special words that describe the idea of righteousness, such as &quot;having a straight heart,&quot; &quot;being upright,&quot; &quot;walking in God&apos;s path,&quot; or other things like that.</p><p><em>You may ask the people in the group to act out in pairs, without using the word righteous, what righteousness means. Afterwards, discuss what you have seen and talk about whether the dramas were accurately explaining what righteousness means in the Bible. This activity can help you to find a way to explain righteousness in your translation.</em></p>",
