    "content": "<p>A <strong>fishing net</strong> is a tool that people use to catch fish. People knot thin rope together to make a kind of cloth that is basically just lots of little holes. A fisherman will throw the net in the water and then pull it back up when fish have swam into the net. When the fisherman pulls up the net, the water will drain out of the net, but the fish will not be able to escape through the little holes and they are caught.</p><p><em>You can look at a picture of a fishing net in the visual Bible dictionary.</em></p>",
