## wine (id: 341025)

Wine is fermented grape juice. People make grape juice from grapes. Grapes are a soft, juicy fruit that grow on a grapevine. People pour the grapes onto a stone and then they trample on the grapes with their feet. This would squeeze out the juice from the grapes. The juice would flow into a container called a wine vat. Another way of taking out the juice was by rolling a heavy stone over the grapes. People would then store the grape juice in jars until it fermented into alcohol, which takes several days to several weeks.

Wine in the Bible is usually red in color and can symbolize life, blood, joy, and celebration when people use it well. Although people can use wine well, when people drink too much wine, wine can cause them to become drunk, which makes them lose control of themselves. This can be bad for both themselves and for others.
