## Israel (id: 280207)

**Israel** is the name of the country where the Israelites lived. The name comes from Abraham's grandson, Israel. Abraham was the first ancestor of the Israelites. Abraham's grandson was named Jacob, but God later gave Jacob the name Israel. Since that time, Abraham's descendants are called Israelites.

At some point, the Israelites fought among themselves and because of this the country of Israel split in two parts. The southern part became known as Judah, while the northern part was still called Israel.

Because of all this, sometimes the word Israel refers to one man, namely Abraham's grandson Jacob who was later called Israel.

Sometimes the word Israel refers to all the descendants of Abraham together. It then means the same as Israelites, or as people of Israel.

Sometimes the word Israel refers to the land, or the country, where the Israelites lived.

And sometimes the word Israel refers only to the northern part of that country.

Today, "Israel" is the name of the country formed as a homeland for the Jewish people after 1948\. This is not exactly the same area of land where the biblical Israelites lived.
