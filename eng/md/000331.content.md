## Savior (id: 280092)

A **Savior** is someone who rescues people from a difficult or dangerous situation. All people are in a desperate situation and need God to save them. God saved us by sending his son Jesus into the world. Anybody who trusts in Jesus will be saved. Therefore, the Bible says that Jesus is our Savior.
