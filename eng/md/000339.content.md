## seed (id: 280216)

In a plant, a **seed** is the small part of a plant from which a new plant can grow. People can collect the seeds of a plant and put it in the soil to grow more plants.

With humans, the seed of a man is another way to talk about a man's descendants. When you talk about the seed of a man, you can be talking about one person, or about a group of people who are this person's descendants.
