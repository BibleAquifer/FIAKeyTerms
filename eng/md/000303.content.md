## rabbi (id: 280089)

**Rabbi** is a name that people in Israel gave a religious teacher. In their language the word means "my great one," or "my great teacher." When someone calls another person "Rabbi," they are giving that person respect. Some translations keep the word "Rabbi," and other translations just say "teacher."

**When you are translating Rabbi, be careful about the following things:**

You can use a word or phrase in your language that means "teacher." But the word should not be a word that is only used for a teacher of children in a school.
