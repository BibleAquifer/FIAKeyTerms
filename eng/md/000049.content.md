## camel (id: 280171)

A **camel** is a large, strong animal that can walk for a very long distance without needing food or water. People sat on camels while traveling, and used camels to carry luggage. A camel has one or two humps on its back. Inside these humps, the camel stores fat which allows the camel to go for a long time without food or water. Once a camel has an opportunity to drink, it will drink an enormous amount of water at one time.

A camel was the largest animal that existed in Israel.

People could make the short, stiff hair of a camel into cloth. This made simple and rough clothing. John the baptizer wore clothes made from camel hair.

*You can look in the video dictionary for a picture of a camel.*
