## Son of Man (id: 280126)

The **Son of Man** is a title that Jesus gives to himself. Whenever Jesus says something about the "Son of Man," he is saying it about himself. In Hebrew, the language of the Old Testament, this phrase just means "a human being," but Jesus is giving the word a special meaning.

The phrase "Son of Man" occurs in a special way in the Old Testament, in the book of Daniel. Daniel was an Israelite who lived about 600 years before Jesus. At one time he had a vision in which he saw someone who looked like a "Son of Man." In Daniel's vision God gave all authority to this person, and this person became a king, and all the people in the world served him. His kingdom never ended.

When Jesus calls himself the "Son of Man," he is therefore saying to the people: "I am the person from Daniel's vision. I am the king, and God has given me all authority." It is another way of saying that Jesus is the Messiah\-the special king and Savior that God has promised to send\-but in a less direct way. At the time of Jesus the people did not use the term "Son of Man" as another title for the Messiah. So when Jesus called himself the "Son of Man," the people did not immediately think about the Messiah. However, the people did come to realise that Jesus was claiming to have all authority from God. The people had to figure out slowly what Jesus meant when he called himself the "Son of Man."

The original audience understood that Jesus was talking about himself when he talked about the Son of Man. If your audience will not understand that Jesus was talking about himself, you may need to make that clear. If you would like to make more clear what "Son of Man" means, you can say something like "I who came from God with God's authority."

Or, if you would like to keep the meaning unclear, as it is in the Bible, you may need to make it clear that "Son of Man" is a title. You can say something like "I, the one who is called the 'Son of Man,' or the 'Son of Humanity.'"
