## Sadducee (id: 280219)

In the time of Jesus there were 2 important groups of religious teachers in Israel. These were the Pharisees and the **Sadducees**. The Pharisees were very concerned about obeying God's law completely, and they even made up additional laws. They wanted to keep themselves separated from people who did not follow God's law. The Sadducees only followed the written laws in the first five books of the Old Testament. They believed that only the first five books of the Old Testament were important. They did not believe in any life after death, and they did not believe that angels or Satan existed.

Unlike the Pharisees, the Sadducees in Jesus's time cooperated with the Roman government, and therefore they had more political power and influence.

Some of the priests in Jerusalem were members of the Sadducees group. Some members of the Sadducees were also part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious court.
