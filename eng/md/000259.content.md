## miracles (id: 280097)

A **miracle**, sometimes called a **wonder**, is something that happens that is very unusual and surprising and seems impossible. Someone who performs a miracle makes an unusual and impossible thing happen. In the Old Testament, God often performed a miracle when people prayed for help. Sometimes God performed a miracle to punish people. Sometimes the prophets\-the people who gave messages from God to the people\-performed miracles through the power of God. In the New Testament, Jesus and later his followers performed miracles.

In the Bible, a miracle is never happening just to create some excitement, but is always happening to teach the people something. God performs miracles to show the people that he is powerful and that they can trust him. When a person performs a miracle, this shows the people that God has given this person authority, and the people should pay attention to what this person is telling about God. A miracle also shows that God is at work. For this reason, miracles are also called **signs** and we often hear the words **signs and wonders** together. These words mean similar things.

However, Jesus also warned the people that they had to be careful and should not get excited about every miracle they saw or about every impossible thing that happened, because sometimes people performed a miracle not by the power of God, but by the power of Satan. Satan can deceive people by also making miracles happen. People have to be careful to distinguish between a miracle that comes from God, and a miracle that is done to turn people away from God, or to make people believe false teaching.
