## Syrian Phoenicia (id: 280080)

**Phoenicia** is the name of an area north of Israel. Phoenicia was a narrow strip consisting of five cities on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.

In the time of the New Testament this area belonged to the country named Syria. For that reason, someone who came from that area could be called a "Syrian Phoenician." Many other people who lived in this area had come from other countries, especially Greece. A lot of people in this area were involved in trade\-the buying and selling of goods, especially by means of ships.

Today, this area is part of the country we now know as Lebanon.
