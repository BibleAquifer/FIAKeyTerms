## generations (id: 280218)

A **generation** refers to a group of people who are living at the same time and belong to about the same age group. In a community, three generations of people can be living at the same time: grandparents, parents, and children. Each of these people belong to a different generation.

Sometimes God, or Jesus, talks about "the people of this generation." This means all the people who are alive at that particular time.

In the Old Testament, the phrase "these are the generations of this person..." is used to introduce a series of stories about this person. In this case, it means something like "this is the history of this person."
