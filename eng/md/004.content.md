## David (id: 280046)

**David** was the second king of Israel. He lived about 1000 years before the birth of Jesus.

David was the youngest son of a man named Jesse. David took care of his father's sheep. Jesse and his family lived in the village called Bethlehem. David's older brothers were soldiers in the army of King Saul, the first king of Israel. King Saul had been disobedient to God, and so God had rejected him. Because of that, God instructed the prophet Samuel to anoint\-which means to appoint\-David as the next king. But that was a secret at first, and Saul remained king for several more years. David became a commander in the king's army, and God helped him so that, through David, Israel could win many battles. David was very popular with the people, and his best friend was Jonathan, a son of King Saul. King Saul became jealous of David and tried to kill him several times, so David had to flee. David gathered a group of men around him and lived away from the people in the mountains. The king sometimes chased after David, and David, more than once, had an opportunity to kill the king, but he never did.

One time, when King Saul and his army were fighting with some enemies, the Israelites lost a battle and King Saul and his sons were killed. After this, the people of Israel made David their king. David began to live in Jerusalem, which became the most important city in Israel.

David became Israel's most beloved king. He loved God and trusted him. Therefore God called him a "man after God's heart." David very much wanted to build a temple for God, but God told David that not David, but David's son, would build this temple. And God gave David a very important promise. God promised David that one of his descendants would always rule over Israel.

This does not mean that David never did anything wrong. In fact, he did some terrible things: He committed adultery and murder. But he repented of his sins, and God forgave him. But even though God forgave him, the effect of David's sins meant that that from that time onwards there was always quarreling and violence in his family, and several of his sons died. Some of David's sons tried to replace their father as king by force, and one time David had to flee from his own son!

When David became very old, he made his son Solomon king in his place.

Hundreds of years after David's death, the nation of Israel no longer existed. The Israelites had been disobedient to God and, in order to punish them, God sent people from another country to conquer them. The Israelites were defeated and from that time onwards, they were ruled by other nations. No longer was there a descendant of David ruling over Israel. But God never forgets a promise, and so the people were waiting for God to again give them a descendant of David as king. God fulfilled this promise through Jesus.

## demon (id: 280061)

The phrases **demon**, evil spirits, or **unclean spirit** all refer to the same thing. A demon is a spirit that is rebelling against God. The leader of all demons is called Satan, the devil, or sometimes Beelzebul. Because God created everything that exists, God also created these spirits. God created them good, as angels, to do his work. But some angels rebelled against God, and these became evil spirits. These evil spirits try to destroy and deceive people.

Demons can take control of people so that people become sick or behave in a strange way. When a demon takes control of a person, we say that the person is "demon possessed." A person who was possessed by a demon could become deaf, mute, or have fits that resemble epileptic attacks. The person could become very violent and shout. Jewish people tried to drive out demons from people through rituals that could last a long time. But Jesus drove out many demons from people during his time on earth, and he did this only by commanding the demons to leave!

Demons can also be called evil spirits. This makes clear that their intentions are evil. They sometimes are called unclean spirits. Something that is unclean is unfit for service to God.

**When you are translating demon, be careful about the following things:**

Demons are not the spirits of humans who have died, though in many cultures they may pretend that this is what they are. If you have to use a term that means spirits of dead people, then be aware that the people will have to learn over time that these spirits are not really spirits of dead people, but are only pretending to be so.

## devil (id: 280099)

The name Satan means the adversary, enemy, or accuser. It is the name for **the Devil**, the leader of all evil spirits.

God has created everything that exists, and therefore God also created all the spirits. God created them good, as angels, to do his work. But some angels rebelled against God, and then they became evil spirits. The most powerful of these evil spirits is called the devil, or Satan.

Satan always tries to destroy God's work. Satan tempts people to disobey God. He tries to make people turn away from God by deceiving them. Satan is powerful and dangerous, always looking for ways that he can work against God and against God's people.

Because Satan is still powerful in this time, sometimes the Bible calls him the "ruler of this world." Sometimes Satan is called **Beelzebub**, which means something like "master of the high places." Sometimes he is called **the Deceiver**. Sometimes he is compared to a dragon or a snake.

However, God is much stronger than Satan. When Jesus died and was resurrected, God broke the power of Satan. Even though God is still allowing Satan to use his power for now, when Jesus will come back, Jesus will defeat Satan forever. God will punish Satan and all the evil spirits, and they will never be able to work against God and his people again.

## disciple (id: 280210)

A **disciple** is a person who follows a religious teacher as a student.

In the New Testament, all people who follow Jesus and want to learn from him are disciples. Sometimes Jesus sent groups of disciples out to preach the good news that the kingdom of God had come and to heal the sick.

Jesus also chose 12 people to be his special disciples. This small group is often called "the 12 disciples," or even just "the 12\." These people followed Jesus everywhere, learning from him and watching him. These 12 disciples were also called apostles. An apostle is someone who has received a special authority from Jesus.

Before Jesus went back to heaven, he told his disciples to "go out and make all people from all nations my disciples." Every person who trusts in Jesus and wants to obey him is a disciple of Jesus.

Sometimes the word "disciples" is used for a large group of people, and sometimes it means only the 12 chosen disciples.

**When you are translating disciple, be careful about the following things:**

If your language has a word that means the follower of a respected teacher, you may use that term here.

Remember that you need to have a different word for apostle as well.

## divination (id: 341019)

**Divination** is a way to communicate with spirits or gods. God has strictly forbidden his people to use divination.

People from other nations used divination to find out what would happen in the future, or what the meaning was of a dream or of some unusual event. People sometimes used divination to find out what the best time would be for a certain activity; for instance, to find out when to start an attack on another country.

There were different ways that people did divination. For example, some people would kill an animal and then look at the way that the organs of the animal were shaped. If the organ looked a certain way, then they thought that a certain thing would happen. If it looked different, then something else would happen. Or, people looked at the way that smoke moved when they burned something, and thought that different movements had different meanings. Other people looked at the stars and the planets in the sky and took meaning from their position.

God has forbidden his people to use divination. God's people do not need to use such rituals to find out what God wants! God tells people what he wants from them through his Scriptures and through messengers who speak God's messages, and God's people need to trust God for the future.

## divorce (id: 280067)

**Divorce** is a permanent and legal separation between a husband and wife. In the Old Testament, the law of God allowed a man to divorce his wife if he thought she had a relationship with another man. However, God makes clear that he hates divorce. God wants husband and wife to live together in harmony and to be dedicated to each other.

In the New Testament, Jesus also teaches the people that divorce is wrong. God meant for husband and wife to live together in unity.

## donkey (id: 280085)

A **donkey** is an animal that is big enough to carry heavy loads or people. People kept donkeys to help them work in their fields or to carry burdens. A donkey was considered an animal of peace, in contrast to a horse, which is a larger animal that soldiers rode on when they were fighting battles in war.

## dove (id: 280084)

A **dove** is a type of bird that is very common in Israel. There are different types and sizes of doves. Some are white and others are speckled or have several colors. A dove is considered a gentle and peaceful bird. Doves can fly long distances, and they are very good at finding their way back to where they came from.

God required the Israelites to offer animal sacrifices to him during different rituals. Usually these animals were sheep, goats, or bulls. For poor people these animals were too expensive. Therefore, God allowed people to sacrifice a pair of doves instead.

When Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit came down on him looking like a dove. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is a dove, only that at that time the Holy Spirit looked like a dove.

## drachma (id: 341038)

A **drachma** is a silver Greek coin worth about a day's wages. People in Jesus' time usually used the silver Roman coin that they called a denarius, but it is possible that sometimes people in the time of Jesus used the silver Greek coins that they called drachmas. It is also possible that people used the word drachma to refer to a denarius. A denarius is around the same size and is worth about the same amount as a drachma.

## dream (id: 341013)

When you are sleeping but you experience some events that are not really happening, or you are seeing things that are not really there, you have a **dream**. God can use dreams to communicate to people. God can use dreams to tell people what will happen in the future, or to tell them something that they need to do.

A dream is different from a vision. A dream happens when you are asleep, but a vision happens when you are awake. When you have a vision, you see something or hear something that other people around you cannot see or hear, even though they might be right next to you. God also uses visions to communicate to people, just as he uses dreams.
