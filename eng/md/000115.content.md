## el-roi (id: 341023)

**El\-Roi** is a name that Hagar, in the book of Genesis, gives to God. The name means "God sees me." Hagar gave this name to God because God helped her when she and her son Ishmael were alone in the desert and about to die from thirst.

The word "el" means God, and therefore we find several other names for God in the Bible that begin with this word "el." Each of these names tells us something important about God.
