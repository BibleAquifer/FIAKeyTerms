## wickedness (id: 341011)

**Wickedness** means the same as evil. Evil is the opposite of good.

A person who is evil, or wicked, willingly does bad things that hurt other people. When people stop obeying God, they begin to do evil actions.

Because humans are so disobedient to God, the Bible teaches us that our hearts have become evil. Instead of wanting to do good things, we want to do bad things. Very many problems in the world like war, poverty, and injustice, happen because of the evil inside people's hearts. Even sickness and death is ultimately a result of evil.

God hates evil. When God will establish his kingdom forever, he will destroy evil. Nothing that is evil will enter God's kingdom. Until that time, God still allows evil to happen. Why he allows this is one of the most difficult questions for Christians!
