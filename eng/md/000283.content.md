## Pharisee (id: 280087)

**Pharisees** were a group of religious teachers in Jesus's time who were very concerned about obeying God's law completely. For hundreds of years, people belonging to this group had been discussing the laws of God that God had given to the Israelites through Moses. Because they were afraid that they might somehow disobey God, they had added more and more rules themselves. These rules became part of their tradition, and were just as important for them as the rules that God had given himself. There were by now so many rules, that it was very, very difficult for people to follow them all. The Pharisees were very proud because they thought that only they were able to obey all God's rules. They looked down on people who were not able to follow these rules. The name Pharisee literally means "to be separated." The Pharisees wanted to keep themselves separated from the other people.

At the time of Jesus, the Pharisees were the most influential group of religious teachers in Israel. Many of the religious teachers in Jerusalem belonged to the Pharisee group. Another important group of religious teachers is called the Sadducees. Pharisees and Sadducees were also part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious court.
