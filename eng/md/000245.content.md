## Lord (id: 280191)

A **Lord** is someone who is a master over other people, who has full authority, and who deserves for people to give him respect. When you address someone as "Lord," you are saying that person has authority over you. In the Bible, we hear people address their king as Lord; slaves call their master Lord; and sometimes a wife calls her husband Lord.

God is called the Lord because he has authority over the whole world. When people talk to God, or talk about God, they often call him Lord in order to give him respect.

In the New Testament, when the people in Israel talked to Jesus and called him Lord, they meant to give him respect.

When, after the resurrection of Jesus, people talk about Jesus and call him Lord, they are saying that Jesus has authority over them, just like God has. When people call Jesus Lord after his resurrection, they are saying that Jesus is God.

Sometimes it is not clear in the New Testament when the word Lord refers to Jesus, or to God the Father.

**When you are translating Lord, be careful about the following things:**

Before Jesus's resurrection, most people did not yet think that Jesus was God. When they said "Lord" to Jesus, this was meant as a respectful term: They did not mean to say "God" to Jesus. In your translation, you might want to use a general respectful term in these cases, rather than using the same word as you are using for "Lord" when it means God.
