## drachma (id: 341038)

A **drachma** is a silver Greek coin worth about a day's wages. People in Jesus' time usually used the silver Roman coin that they called a denarius, but it is possible that sometimes people in the time of Jesus used the silver Greek coins that they called drachmas. It is also possible that people used the word drachma to refer to a denarius. A denarius is around the same size and is worth about the same amount as a drachma.
