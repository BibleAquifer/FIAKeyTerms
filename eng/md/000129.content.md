## fear of God (id: 280055)

When someone **fears God**, they have a great reverence, honor, and respect for God. They believe that everything that God has said is true. As a result they obey God, because they know that God's commandments are good, and that God will punish them if they disobey him. People who fear God hate everything that is against God's commands. It is necessary for people to fear God, because God is so much bigger, powerful, and holy than we are!

Only when people fear God can they become wise and understanding.

Because Jesus has died for people's sin, it is now possible for people to come to God without being afraid of him. But we should still greatly respect God and realize that He is very powerful. When we fear God it helps us to do good things instead of bad things, because we know that he is still able to punish us.
