## oath (id: 280096)

When people make a promise to each other, they can swear an **oath** to make the promise more serious. When someone swears an oath, they say: "I will absolutely keep my promise. If I do not, God may punish me."

If someone did not keep his promise after swearing an oath, we say that he has broken his oath. It was an utterly disgraceful and dangerous thing to break an oath.

When God made a promise to people, he often made an oath as well. There is no one higher than God who can punish God if he breaks an oath, so God made these oaths in his own name, meaning that he would punish himself if he broke his promise.
