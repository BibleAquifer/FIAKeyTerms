## possessed (id: 280077)

Someone who is **possessed** by a demon, which is an evil spirit, is under the control of this demon. The demon can make the person behave in an unusual or violent way, or it can make the person sick and make him suffer.

A demon can also give a person special powers, so that person knows things that are hidden for other people. In the cultures surrounding Israel, sometimes people tried to become possessed by a demon in order to know what would happen in the future, or to receive some secret knowledge. God forbade the Israelites to do this.
