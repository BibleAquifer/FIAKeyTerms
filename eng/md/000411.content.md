## worship (id: 280052)

When we **worship** God, we give honor to God. We say that God deserves all our thanks, our praises, and our respect. When we worship God, we are in awe and wonder about how good and powerful and loving God is, and how different he is from us humans!

Only God deserves our worship. We should not worship anything or anyone else.

People in the Bible often showed their worship to God by bowing down to him. People worshiped God together, or just by themselves. During the time in Israel's history when they had the temple of God, people worshiped God together at the temple. They worshiped God through their songs, prayers, and sacrifices. But these activities of worship were useless if their hearts were not obedient to God. God told them that he rejects people's worship of him if they treat other people with cruelty and injustice.

In the time of the New Testament, the Jews also met together for worship in synagogues. A synagogue is a place where Jewish people gather for teaching and learning about God. The Jews also prayed and worshiped God in the synagogues. But Jesus also made it clear that God cares more about our love for him than about the place where we worship.

After Jesus had gone back to heaven, his followers at first still worshiped God in the temple and in the synagogues. Later, when more and more people who were not Jews became followers of Jesus, the people began to meet together especially in people's homes. They worshiped God together through preaching, prayer, singing, and by other activities.

But worship is not something that we do only at particular times, and in groups. Everything we do, even ordinary daily tasks, can be worship if we do them for God. Our whole life and all our actions should be a worship to God. God has been so good to us, and because we are so grateful to him we worship him in everything that we do.
