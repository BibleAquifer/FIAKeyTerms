## authority (id: 280107)

Someone who has **authority** has the right and the power to make decisions and judgments. The highest authority belongs to God. God can give authority to other people to make decisions or judgments on his behalf. God will often show that he has given authority to people by also giving them power to do miracles.

Jesus has authority because he is the king, and God sent him.

The apostles had authority in the church, because Jesus gave it to them. Other people needed to accept their decisions.

The Bible has authority because God is speaking to the people through the Bible. This means that people have to listen to what God tells them through the Bible.
