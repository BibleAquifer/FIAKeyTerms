## household (id: 280151)

In the Bible, a **household** means all the people who are living together in one **house**. The father was usually the head of the household. The household included his wife, children, unmarried daughters, and any married sons and their wives and children. There might be other relatives living with them as well. If the family had servants or slaves, then they were included in the household as well.

People also used the word "house" instead of "household." If someone said "me and my house," they meant "me and all the people in my household."

People could also use the word household, or house, to mean a large group of people who did not live in the same house, but who had something in common. For instance, the Israelites are sometimes called the "house of Israel."
