## bow (id: 280186)

When a person **bows** down before someone else, they lower their head or the whole top of their body forward. They do this to show respect and humility. A person can also bow down by kneeling in front of a person and putting their head to the ground.

Sometimes people even stretched themselves out flat on the ground in front of a person. This is called falling at someone's feet.
