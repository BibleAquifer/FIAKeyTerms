## robe (id: 280192)

A **cloak**, also called a **robe**, is a piece of clothing. People wear a cloak on top of other clothes. A cloak helps to keep people warm and dry and can be used as a blanket at night. People made cloaks from animal skin or wool, which is the hair of an animal named a sheep. A cloak was often a simple square piece of material with holes for the arms.

*You can look in the visual Bible dictionary for a picture of a cloak.*
