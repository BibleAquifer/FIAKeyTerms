## vow (id: 341033)

A person who is making a **vow** is asking God to do something for them, and is offering to do something in return or to stop doing something. People can make vows to show that they are devoted to God. God does not require people to make vows. But, if a person makes a vow, the vow is seriously binding like an oath. God releases the person from the vow once he has done what he vowed to do.

Jacob asked God to bring him back to the land of his father, and if God would do this, then Jacob would worship God. Jacob was making a vow.

Hannah asked God to give her a son, and promised that if God would do so, Hannah would give the son back to God to serve him. Hannah was making a vow.
