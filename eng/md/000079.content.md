## curse (id: 280110)

To **curse** someone is the opposite of to bless someone. When you bless someone, you wish that something good will happen to the person you bless. When you curse them, you wish that something bad will happen to them. People believed that a curse would come true. If someone cursed them, they became very afraid.

When God curses someone, the bad thing that God says will happen will certainly happen. God curses people to punish them. God told the Israelites that if they obeyed God, God would bless them. If they disobeyed God, God would curse them.
