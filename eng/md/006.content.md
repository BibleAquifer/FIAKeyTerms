## faith (id: 280102)

To believe and to have **faith** mean the same thing.

If you believe in someone, you believe that what that person says about himself is true. You then trust that person and are committed to do what that person tells you to do.

Abraham believed that God spoke the truth when he promised that Abraham would have many descendants, even though Abraham was already old and did not have even one child. Abraham trusted that God would fulfill his promise, even though it seemed impossible.

If you believe in God, you accept that God exists and that what God says in the Bible is true. You trust that God will fulfill all his promises, even when it seems impossible. As a result, you are committed to obey everything that God wants you to do.

When you believe in Jesus, you believe that Jesus is indeed the son of God. You trust that Jesus has indeed died for your sins, and that God has forgiven and accepted you. As a result, you are committed to do everything that Jesus has commanded.

The Bible sometimes says that people should believe in Jesus's *name*. This means the same thing as to believe in Jesus.

Someone who has great faith or belief, trusts God\-or Jesus\-very much.

**When you are translating "believe," be careful about the following things:**

In some languages, the word "believe" can sound as if someone only *hopes* that something is true, but they are not sure. This is not the right meaning. Therefore, sometimes it can be better to use a word that means "trust."

*Ask one person to volunteer to be the person who has to trust, or have faith. That person should stand with their back to a group of at least 5 people, if you have that many people. Those five people should stand right behind the volunteer. They should be capable and willing to catch the volunteer. Ask the volunteer to fall back into the arms of the group of people. Do you hesitate to do that? How do you feel as you decide whether or not to fall back into the arms of the group?*

Maybe the volunteer chooses to not actually fall back, even though you know that your friends will catch you. How does the group feel when the volunteer chooses to not fall back into their arms?

Maybe the volunteer chooses to fall back into the group's arms. How does the volunteer feel after the group catches him? How does the group feel, knowing that the person has trusted them? This is an example of having faith, or trusting. You do not trust unless you really fall back into the arms of the group. You may say that you trust them, but true trust does not happen until you fall. Trusting means to act on what you say. \[!end] Pause the recording here.

## fasting (id: 280093)

When someone is **fasting**, they are not eating or drinking anything for a certain amount of time.

There were certain times in the year when the Israelites were supposed to fast, but people could also fast at other times if they wanted. And sometimes people had no choice, and had to fast because there was no food.

Sometimes people were fasting because they were sad about something that had happened.

Sometimes people were fasting because they wanted to repent\-or ask forgiveness\-for their sins. Fasting was then a sign of humility.

Sometimes people were fasting because they needed God to help them, or they wanted God to tell them what to do. Fasting was then a way to show God how serious the problem was.

Sometimes people thought that if they fasted, God would be very pleased with them and give them what they wanted\-but they kept doing sinful things! But God told the people through his prophets that this was wrong. There is no point in fasting if you do not obey God as well.

In the time of Jesus, sometimes the people would fast in order to make other people think that they were very good and religious people. But Jesus told them that they should not fast to make themselves look good. They should not make a big show of their fasting in front of other people!

**When you are translating fasting, be careful about the following things:**

People in many cultures know the practice of fasting. When you translate the word fasting, be careful that the word in your language does not mean fasting in honor of a particular god, or is used for fasting in a particular religion only. Be also careful that the word is not only used for fasting for one particular reason. You may need to use a different word or phrase that explains the biblical practice of fasting.

## fear of God (id: 280055)

When someone **fears God**, they have a great reverence, honor, and respect for God. They believe that everything that God has said is true. As a result they obey God, because they know that God's commandments are good, and that God will punish them if they disobey him. People who fear God hate everything that is against God's commands. It is necessary for people to fear God, because God is so much bigger, powerful, and holy than we are!

Only when people fear God can they become wise and understanding.

Because Jesus has died for people's sin, it is now possible for people to come to God without being afraid of him. But we should still greatly respect God and realize that He is very powerful. When we fear God it helps us to do good things instead of bad things, because we know that he is still able to punish us.

## Festival of Unleavened Bread (id: 280143)

Passover is an important Jewish festival that is also called the Festival, or Feast, of Unleavened Bread.

This feast reminded the people about a very important time in the history of Israel.

A very long time ago, Abraham's descendants, the Israelites, had become slaves in Egypt. The Israelites had lived in Egypt for four hundred years! God then called one of the Israelites, Moses, to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and back to Canaan, the land that God had promised to give to Abraham's descendants. The king of Egypt did not just allow this big group of slaves to walk out of his country. The king made things very difficult for the Israelites, but God sent nine plagues to the Egyptians in order to force the king to let the people go. During each plague, the king promised that the Israelites could go, but as soon as God stopped the plague, the king changed his mind again. And so, God caused the tenth and most terrible plague of all: God sent an angel to kill the eldest son in each house in Egypt. But God had told the Israelites to kill a lamb, which is an animal, a young sheep, and to smear the blood of this lamb on the doorposts of their houses. When the angel that God had sent saw the blood of the lamb on the door of a house, he would skip that house and not kill the oldest son in that family.

That same night, the Israelites had to eat the meat of this lamb in a special way. They had to eat the meat together with bitter herbs and with bread that they had prepared quickly\-different from the normal way that they prepared bread, that took a long time. They had to eat this meal while standing up, all dressed up ready to start traveling! Because during this night, they would be leaving Egypt.

That night, the angel from God killed all of the eldest sons in Egypt, except for the sons of the Israelites, because they had blood over their doors. That night, the king of Egypt finally let the Israelites go. The Israelites began their long travel towards the land that God had promised to give them! They were no longer slaves. From that time onwards, the Israelites would remember how God gave them freedom from Egypt by celebrating the Passover festival every year. The name Passover means "to skip over" or "to step over." This name reminded the Israelites of how the angel had skipped over the houses of the Israelites, and had not killed their oldest sons.

Every time that the Israelites celebrated Passover, they again killed a lamb and ate this meat together with bitter herbs and with bread that was prepared very quickly. The lamb reminded them of how God saved their oldest sons. The bitter herbs reminded them of the bitterness, the difficulty, that they had faced while they were slaves. And the bread that was prepared quickly reminded them that God freed them from Egypt and that they suddenly had to leave quickly.

God had told the Israelites that the yearly Passover feast should be combined with seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. During these seven days they should eat the special bread that was prepared quickly. Normally, the Israelites made bread by letting the dough, a mixture of flour and water, rest for several hours, or overnight, before they baked the bread. The long wait caused some air bubbles to grow inside the dough, and this made the bread bigger and softer. Every time that they baked bread, they would keep some of the dough until next time. This piece of leftover dough was called a leaven, or yeast. The next time they would bake bread, they would take the leaven that they had kept from the previous time and add it to the new dough. This helped the new dough to also become bigger and softer.

When the Israelites were leaving Egypt on the first Passover night, they had no time to bake bread in this way. And God told them to make bread without leaven. Bread that is made without leaven is flat and thin; it is just flour and water that is kneaded and rolled flat, and then baked over a fire. This bread was called unleavened bread. Therefore, this feast is called the feast of unleavened bread. During the seven days of this feast, the Israelites could not keep even the smallest part of leaven in their house. Before the feast started, they had to throw away any leaven that they still had.

Because the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were celebrated together, the names for the feasts are often used interchangeably.

In the New Testament, leaven is sometimes used as a symbol for sin that we should get rid of in our lives.

## fishing net (id: 280167)

A **fishing net** is a tool that people use to catch fish. People knot thin rope together to make a kind of cloth that is basically just lots of little holes. A fisherman will throw the net in the water and then pull it back up when fish have swam into the net. When the fisherman pulls up the net, the water will drain out of the net, but the fish will not be able to escape through the little holes and they are caught.

## foreigner (id: 341030)

A person is a **foreigner** in a country when they are in a country that is not where they were born. Strangers or sojourners are people who are foreigners in a country and temporarily live there, even though it is not where they were born. Abraham was a foreigner, or stranger, in Canaan. Later, when Abraham's descendants the Israelites made Canaan their own country, God gave them guidelines about how they should treat foreigners, and strangers or sojourners, who traveled through their country and who lived there among the Israelites.

## forgiveness (id: 280051)

When you **forgive** someone who has done something bad to you, you stop being angry with that person. You no longer want to take revenge or to give punishment. The person who had done the wrong thing is then **forgiven**, or has received **forgiveness**.

Forgiveness is costly. For example, one brother, out of carelessness, breaks an expensive item that belongs to his sister. The sister can forgive the brother and not demand that he pays back the money. This is good news for the brother. The sister, however, now has the expense of replacing the broken item herself.

This is also how forgiveness works with God. People have sinned against God and deserve to be punished. People have to pay God back for the damage they have done. However, God wants to forgive people by saying that they do not have to pay him back\-because he knows that they cannot! God forgives people because he has mercy on them. This is good news for people. For God himself, this meant that God paid the price of the damage himself. God did this through the death of his son Jesus. When people trust in Jesus and believe that Jesus's death has paid God back for their own sins, then God forgives them. God is no longer angry with them.

The Bible often uses picture language to describe forgiveness. For instance, if you forgive someone you:

* wipe away their sins
* cut away their sins
* lift up their sins
* loose them, release them
* throw away their sins
* cover their sins
* pass by their sins
* take away their sins
* turn your back on their sins

**When you are translating "forgiveness," or "to forgive," be careful about the following things:**

You may have picture language in your own language for forgiving. Carefully think whether the meaning of the phrase in your language means the same as the meaning of "to forgive" in the Bible.

*Try having the translation team mime or act out a scene where someone forgives someone else. Watch what actions they do to show that they forgive. Ask them to explain the emotions of each of the characters in the scene.*
