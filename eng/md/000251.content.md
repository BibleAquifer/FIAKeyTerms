## master (id: 280189)

A master is a general respectful title for someone in a high position or status. In the New Testament, there are two titles of respect for someone in a high position. Lord is often the title for someone who owns property or is a supreme ruler. Master often refers to someone in high position in a household or someone with a lot of responsibility. Sometimes people use both of these words as a respectful title to refer to the same person.
