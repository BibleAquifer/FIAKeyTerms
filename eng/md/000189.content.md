## Hosanna (id: 280147)

In the Old Testament, the word **Hosanna** means "save us." We can hear this word in Psalm 118\. In this Psalm, the singer asks God to save the people, and then begins to praise God. Because of that, by the time of the New Testament people used the word Hosanna as a way to praise God with great joy, because they trusted that God was going to save them soon. The practical meaning of the word Hosanna in the New Testament is therefore "praise God."

**When you are translating Hosanna, be careful about the following things:**

You can translate Hosanna as "praise God!" Be sure that you make clear to your listeners that the people who are praising God with this word are very happy and excited.

Some translators choose to make up a word in their own language that sounds like "Hosanna." If you want to do that, you may also want to say one time that this word means "praise God."
