## Gentile (id: 280119)

The word **Gentile** comes from a word that means "people" or "nations."

In the Old Testament, God had chosen the Israelites to be his special people. The Israelites had to remain separate from people from other nations in order for the Israelites to remain devoted to God. They should not start to worship the idols from the other nations and follow their bad habits. However, when God had made his covenant with Abraham, the first ancestor of the Israelites, God had also said that through Abraham's descendants *all* the people of the world would be blessed. So, God cared about all people, not only about the Israelites, who were also called Jews.

Over time, the Israelites became proud of their special position and looked down on people who were not Jews. The word Gentile began to mean something negative\-a bad person, someone that you should stay away from. In the time of Jesus, the Romans were ruling the country of Israel. Therefore, many people who were not Jews were also living in Israel. All these people were called Gentiles. The Jews had to cooperate somewhat with the Gentiles, but they were not friendly with them. The Jews strictly forbade Gentiles to enter the temple area, and Jews would never eat together with Gentiles or go inside the home of a Gentile. The Jews believed that interacting with Gentiles would make them "unclean"\-or unfit for worship to God.

Sometimes instead of the word Gentile, we find the word "Greek." A Greek is a person who belongs to the country of Greece, but over time this word began to mean any person who adopted Greek culture. A good Jew would not adopt Greek culture, which involved idol worship. The word Greek therefore also began to be used for any person who was not a Jew, even if the person did not come from Greece. And so, the word "Greek" and "Gentile" can sometimes mean the same thing.
