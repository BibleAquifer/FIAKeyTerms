## sacrifice (id: 280139)

A **sacrifice** is a gift to God. People often placed the gift on a platform made of earth or large stones, which was called an altar. The purpose for a sacrifice could be that people wanted to thank God for something, worship God, confirm their relationship with God, or ask forgiveness for something they had done wrong. A sacrifice could involve the killing of an animal, which then would be burned on the altar. But the gift could also be food items, oil, or sweet smelling spices.

In the beginning of the Old Testament, there are several stories of people giving sacrifices to God: Cain and Abel, Noah, and Abraham. Later, when God gave the Israelites his law through Moses, God gave the people instructions about how to give him sacrifices. People could not bring their sacrifices to God wherever they wanted: They had to bring their sacrifices to the tabernacle, and later to the temple. The tabernacle was the place where the Israelites worshiped God. It was a tent that the Israelites could carry with them during their travels through the wilderness. Later, when the Israelites had settled in their own country, they replaced the tabernacle with a building, called the temple.

In the tabernacle, and later in the temple, priests were special people whom God appointed to make the sacrifices on behalf of the people. The priests made sacrifices every day, and there were also special sacrifices for festivals and rituals. People could also bring a sacrifice voluntarily. The sacrifices were very important in the worship of God. Because God is holy, and people are so sinful, people could not just come before God. People needed to be "cleaned" from their sins. Only someone who is purified\-made ritually clean\-can come before God. The sacrifices helped to make people clean so that they could come before God. However, God also made clear to the people that he did not accept sacrifices if people did not really feel sorry for the bad things that they had done and sincerely wanted to change.

About 40 years after Jesus went back to heaven, the Roman people completely destroyed the temple in Jerusalem. From that time onwards, the Jews could no longer bring sacrifices to God. The New Testament teaches us that Jesus himself was a perfect sacrifice. Jesus died so that God could forgive the people. People do not need to bring sacrifices to God anymore, because Jesus has already made us clean: Jesus has made it possible for us to come before God.
