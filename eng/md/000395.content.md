## vision (id: 280094)

If you have a vision, you are seeing something from God that other people do not see, or are hearing something from God that other people do not hear. God sometimes gives visions to people to tell them about something that will happen in the future, or to tell someone to do something. God can also show people something in a dream, when they are sleeping, but a vision is happening when a person is awake.
