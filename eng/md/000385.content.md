## tomb (id: 280159)

A **tomb** is the name for a place where people bury a dead person. In the Bible, this could be a natural cave in a rock, or it could be a hole that people cut out of rock. Wealthy people could have a large tomb carved out of rock with many decorations. Poor people might be buried inside a natural cave, or even just buried in the sand.

People wrapped a dead body in cloth and placed it directly inside the tomb.

More than one person could be buried in the same tomb. A family could have a tomb in which they buried all their dead family members. Inside the tomb could be shelves for the different bodies.

People closed the opening of a tomb with a pile of rocks, or with one large slab of rock. This rock would be round so that people could roll it away. The rock would be so heavy that it would still take several people to move it away.

*Look in the Bible video dictionary for a picture of a tomb.*
