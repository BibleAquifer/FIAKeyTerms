## wickedness (id: 341011)

**Wickedness** means the same as evil. Evil is the opposite of good.

A person who is evil, or wicked, willingly does bad things that hurt other people. When people stop obeying God, they begin to do evil actions.

Because humans are so disobedient to God, the Bible teaches us that our hearts have become evil. Instead of wanting to do good things, we want to do bad things. Very many problems in the world like war, poverty, and injustice, happen because of the evil inside people's hearts. Even sickness and death is ultimately a result of evil.

God hates evil. When God will establish his kingdom forever, he will destroy evil. Nothing that is evil will enter God's kingdom. Until that time, God still allows evil to happen. Why he allows this is one of the most difficult questions for Christians!

## wine (id: 341025)

Wine is fermented grape juice. People make grape juice from grapes. Grapes are a soft, juicy fruit that grow on a grapevine. People pour the grapes onto a stone and then they trample on the grapes with their feet. This would squeeze out the juice from the grapes. The juice would flow into a container called a wine vat. Another way of taking out the juice was by rolling a heavy stone over the grapes. People would then store the grape juice in jars until it fermented into alcohol, which takes several days to several weeks.

Wine in the Bible is usually red in color and can symbolize life, blood, joy, and celebration when people use it well. Although people can use wine well, when people drink too much wine, wine can cause them to become drunk, which makes them lose control of themselves. This can be bad for both themselves and for others.

## winepress (id: 280050)

A **winepress** is a flat piece of stone with a ledge around it. People in Israel use this to press the juice out of grapes. Grapes are a soft, juicy fruit. People pour the grapes on this stone and then they trample on the grapes with their feet. This would squeeze out the juice from the grapes. The juice would flow into a container called a wine vat. Another way of taking out the juice was by rolling a heavy stone over the grapes.

## wisdom (id: 280066)

When someone is wise, he has **wisdom**. In the Bible, a person who has wisdom understands many things, and is able to make good decisions that lead to good results. When a person has certain skills, like the ability to build or to make something beautiful, the Bible also says that this person has wisdom.

It is God who gives wisdom to people. If a person pretends to be wise but does not accept God, then his wisdom is useless, and eventually his plans will fail. Only a person who accepts and obeys God can be truly wise.

We can hear a lot about wisdom in the book of Proverbs. In this book, the author sometimes talks about wisdom as if it is a person. This is picture language that people used to help others learn about wisdom. And so, Proverbs can say that "wisdom is calling out to people, trying to make people wise." Wisdom is calling just as a person would call. In 1 Corinthians, Paul talks about Jesus and calls Jesus the "wisdom of God." God's plan to save the world through Jesus was very wise\-and therefore, we can be sure that this plan will work!

## Word (id: 280157)

In the Bible, **word** usually means **the word of God**. The word of God means everything that God tells people. God speaks to the people either directly, or through people called prophets. God also speaks through his actions: When people see what God is doing, people can understand what he speaks to them.

When people in the New Testament talk about "the word," or "the word of God," or "the word of the Lord," they usually mean the good news that Jesus has come into the world.

People can know what God tells them through the Scriptures\-the Bible. Therefore, people also call the Scriptures "the word of God."

## worship (id: 280052)

When we **worship** God, we give honor to God. We say that God deserves all our thanks, our praises, and our respect. When we worship God, we are in awe and wonder about how good and powerful and loving God is, and how different he is from us humans!

Only God deserves our worship. We should not worship anything or anyone else.

People in the Bible often showed their worship to God by bowing down to him. People worshiped God together, or just by themselves. During the time in Israel's history when they had the temple of God, people worshiped God together at the temple. They worshiped God through their songs, prayers, and sacrifices. But these activities of worship were useless if their hearts were not obedient to God. God told them that he rejects people's worship of him if they treat other people with cruelty and injustice.

In the time of the New Testament, the Jews also met together for worship in synagogues. A synagogue is a place where Jewish people gather for teaching and learning about God. The Jews also prayed and worshiped God in the synagogues. But Jesus also made it clear that God cares more about our love for him than about the place where we worship.

After Jesus had gone back to heaven, his followers at first still worshiped God in the temple and in the synagogues. Later, when more and more people who were not Jews became followers of Jesus, the people began to meet together especially in people's homes. They worshiped God together through preaching, prayer, singing, and by other activities.

But worship is not something that we do only at particular times, and in groups. Everything we do, even ordinary daily tasks, can be worship if we do them for God. Our whole life and all our actions should be a worship to God. God has been so good to us, and because we are so grateful to him we worship him in everything that we do.
