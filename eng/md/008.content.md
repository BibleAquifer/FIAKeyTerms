The word **hell** is a name for a place where wicked people will be punished after they die.

What happens with people after they die? We may find this strange to hear, but the Bible does not very clearly talk about this. Most Christians say that people who believe in Jesus go to heaven, and people who don't believe go to hell. But the people who lived in the times of the Bible did not always have such a clear idea about this yet.

When people in the Old Testament spoke about what happened to people after they die, they said that people went into the "underworld," or "Sheol." They pictured the underworld as a place that is somewhere underneath our own world. Some passages in the Old Testament speak as if all people, good as well as bad, go to the underworld; other passages speak as if the underworld is a place of punishment for bad people only.

In the New Testament, people also speak about the "underworld." Some translations use the Greek word "Hades" for this. Just as in the time of the Old Testament, the "underworld" sometimes seems to be a neutral place, where all people go after they have died, and sometimes it seems to be a place where wicked people are punished. Sometimes it seems to be a place where all people are waiting until the time that God will judge all people. Sometimes the word "underworld" is just used as another way to speak about death.

Jesus told the people that after death people will either go into the kingdom of God, or they will go into hell. The word hell in the Greek language comes from the name of the place near Jerusalem where at one point in their history the people of Israel had committed a terrible crime. Because of this crime, people avoided this place and began to use it as a place to burn the bodies of dead animals and of people who could not be buried. People always kept a fire burning in this place. Whenever people thought about this place, they felt very bad, and they thought about God punishing people for their terrible crimes. For this reason, people began to use the name of this place as the name for the place where all wicked people will be punished after their death. Jesus makes clear that hell is a terrible place: He uses picture language to describe it as a place with a fire that never goes out, as a place where people will be tortured, or as a place where people will weep and forever regret their choices.

Jesus teaches that hell is also the place where Satan and his demons will be punished.

## heart (id: 280173)

The **heart** is a muscle inside our body that keeps our blood flowing, but in the Bible the heart is used as picture language for the place where a person's thoughts, feelings, and decisions happen. Someone with a "wicked heart" thinks evil things and makes evil decisions. Someone with a "good heart" wants to do the right things, and feels sad when they have sinned. Someone with a "hard heart" does not want to listen to what God tells them to do. Someone whose heart is filled with joy is feeling very glad.

**When you are translating "heart," be careful about the following things:**

You should not translate the word "heart" with the word that is used in your language for the part of your body that pumps blood, *if* in your language this word is not associated with thoughts and feelings. Use a word that people in your language associate with a person's thoughts, feelings, and will.

In Hebrew, the language of the Old Testament, the word for "heart" is the same as the word for "mind." In Greek, the language of the New Testament, these are two different words. In Greek, the word "heart" has a bit more emphasis on feelings, while the word "mind" has more emphasis on the thoughts, the intellect, and the will of a person.

If your language has only one word for this, like in Hebrew, you can use this same word each time. If your language has two different words like in Greek\-or maybe even three or four\-you may need to use different words, depending on each passage.

Please note that you also need to have a word for "mind," "soul," and for "spirit." The words heart, mind, soul, and spirit all have to do with the inner, invisible part of a person, but each of them has a slightly different use. You may want to listen to the explanations of each of these terms, and then discuss all these four terms together. You can then make a decision about how you are going to translate each of these terms. But remember that in each passage you will have to think again if you have chosen the right translation.

In summary:

* **Heart**Heart is picture language for the place where a person's thoughts, feelings, and decisions happen.
* MindThe mind is very similar to heart, but a bit more emphasis on thoughts, intelligence, and the will.
* SoulSoul is the total invisible, inner part of a person. This part of a person may live on even after their body dies.
* SpiritThe spirit is very similar to soul, but with more emphasis on the relationship with God.

## heaven (id: 280214)

The word **heaven** sometimes means the visible sky: the place where birds are flying, where we can see clouds, and where we can see stars at night.

Most of the time, though, the word "heaven" refers to the place where God lives with his angels. This heaven is not somewhere in this universe; it is not a place that humans can travel to. But God can send his angels to earth to do his work, and Jesus came from heaven to earth. After Jesus had died and become alive again, he went back to heaven. He will come back one day to establish the kingdom of God for good. The book of Revelation tells us that when Jesus will come back, there will be a new heaven and a new earth. But these will no longer be separated from each other\-with God in heaven, and the people on earth. Instead, God will live in the midst of his people.

Sometimes it is not clear if, in a certain passage, the word "heaven" means the visible sky or the place where God lives. Sometimes both meanings can be true at the same time. For instance, "rain from heaven" can mean rain that comes from the sky, but it also can mean rain that is sent by God.

Sometimes the Jews used the term "the highest heaven" to make clear that they were not talking about the sky, but about the place where God lived.

Because heaven is the place where God lives, the Jews often used the term "heaven" when they were talking about God. Out of respect for God they preferred not to use the name of God. And so, rather than saying "God," the Jews might say "heaven." That's why the term "the kingdom of heaven" means the same as "the kingdom of God."

The word for heaven in Hebrew, the language of the Old Testament, is plural, or means more than one. We hear it as "heavens." Therefore you will sometimes see "heaven" in translations, and sometimes you will see "heavens." But this means the same thing. It does not mean that there is more than one heaven.

## Hebrew (id: 341034)

The word **Hebrew** can refer to the descendants of Abraham. People call the descendants of Abraham Israelites, Jews, and sometimes Hebrews. The descendants of Abraham often referred to themselves as Hebrews when they were talking with foreigners to make a difference between themselves and people from other ethnic groups. In the same way, foreigners often referred to the descendants of Abraham as Hebrews.

The word Hebrew also refers to the language that the descendants of Abraham spoke. The authors of the Old Testament wrote mostly in Hebrew.

## Hebron (id: 341012)

In the Old Testament, **Hebron** is the name of a city in Israel where several important stories took place.

Before the place became a city, it was a place where Abraham lived for some time. At that time, the place was called Mamre, but people also knew it as Kiriath\-arba. First Sarah, and later Abraham as well, died and were buried in this place. Their son Isaac, his wife Rebecca, and their son Jacob and his wife Leah were also buried there.

Much later, during the time when Joshua was leading the Israelites to conquer the land, the Israelites attacked Hebron and conquered it from the Canaanites who were living there.

Again much later, David became king over the people of Judah while living in Hebron. After several years, David moved to Jerusalem. From that time onwards, the city of Jerusalem became the most important city for the Israelites, and we don't hear much more about Hebron.

## heir (id: 280136)

An **heir** is a person who inherits property or wealth after someone else dies. For the people who lived in the time of the Bible, when a father died, his property went to his son. We say that the son inherits his father's property; he is his father's heir. In the Old Testament, a father's property was divided among all his sons. The oldest son received double from what the other sons received, because after the death of his father he was now the head of the family and had extra responsibilities. If a father did not have sons, his property went to his daughters. If he did not have daughters either, his property went to his nearest relative.

God gave a promise to Abraham that God would bless Abraham's descendants. Abraham's descendants would be a blessing for all nations, and God would give them a land to live in. Abraham's heir was Isaac. After Abraham's death, Abraham's son Isaac inherited this promise. This means that what God had promised to Abraham was now also a promise for Isaac. And after Isaac's death, Isaac's son Jacob inherited this promise. And through Jacob, all the Israelites inherited this promise.

In the New Testament, we learn that all people who trust in Jesus are heirs to this same promise, even if they are not biological descendants from Abraham. This means that what God promised to Abraham, he will give to all people who trust in Jesus.

The New Testament also says that Jesus is the heir of all things. Jesus is the son of God. Now we know of course that God, the father, will never die, so this does not mean that Jesus will inherit these things after God dies. When the Bible says that Jesus is the heir, this means that everything rightfully belongs to Jesus. The whole world belongs to Jesus, and the kingdom of God belongs to Jesus.

The New Testament also calls the people who believe in Jesus "fellow heirs" with Jesus. Jesus is sharing his inheritance with all the people who trust in him as Savior!

## hell (id: 280122)

The word **hell** is a name for a place where wicked people will be punished after they die.

What happens with people after they die? We may find this strange to hear, but the Bible does not very clearly talk about this. Most Christians say that people who believe in Jesus go to heaven, and people who don't believe go to hell. But the people who lived in the times of the Bible did not always have such a clear idea about this yet.

When people in the Old Testament spoke about what happened to people after they die, they said that people went into the **underworld**, or Sheol. They pictured the underworld as a place that is somewhere underneath our own world. Some passages in the Old Testament speak as if all people, good as well as bad, go to the underworld; other passages speak as if the underworld is a place of punishment for bad people only.

In the New Testament, people also speak about the "underworld." Some translations use the Greek word "Hades" for this. Just as in the time of the Old Testament, the "underworld" sometimes seems to be a neutral place, where all people go after they have died, and sometimes it seems to be a place where wicked people are punished. Sometimes it seems to be a place where all people are waiting until the time that God will judge all people. Sometimes the word "underworld" is just used as another way to speak about death.

Jesus told the people that after death people will either go into the kingdom of God, or they will go into hell. The word hell in the Greek language comes from the name of the place near Jerusalem where at one point in their history the people of Israel had committed a terrible crime. Because of this crime, people avoided this place and began to use it as a place to burn the bodies of dead animals and of people who could not be buried. People always kept a fire burning in this place. Whenever people thought about this place, they felt very bad, and they thought about God punishing people for their terrible crimes. For this reason, people began to use the name of this place as the name for the place where all wicked people will be punished after their death. Jesus makes clear that hell is a terrible place: He uses picture language to describe it as a place with a fire that never goes out, as a place where people will be tortured, or as a place where people will weep and forever regret their choices.

Jesus teaches that hell is also the place where Satan and his demons will be punished.

## Herodian (id: 280200)

In the New Testament, the word **Herodians** means a group of people who supported the rule of the Herodian family\-which means king Herod, his son Herod and his grandson Herod. The Roman government had appointed these rulers, and so Herodians were also supportive of the Roman government. In this way they were the opposites of the Pharisees, the group of religious teachers who were against Roman rule. However, the Pharisees and the Herodians worked together against Jesus.

## high priest (id: 280074)

Priests were people who worked in the temple of God in Jerusalem. Priests were responsible for offering sacrifices to God on behalf of the people. They took care of the temple and taught the people how to worship God. The priests were in between God and the people, making it possible for people to come before God. Because people are sinful, they are unclean. In the Bible, to be unclean means to be unfit to come before God. People have to become clean first. The work of the priests was to make people clean\-to purify them. The priests did this by offering sacrifices on behalf of the people, and by teaching people how to live.

One of the priests was named the **high priest**. The high priest was the most important priest. The high priest had a very important function. Once a year there was a festival that was named the Day of Atonement. This means something like "the great day of forgiveness or reconciliation." On this day, the high priest offered a sacrifice on behalf of all the people of Israel to ask for forgiveness for all the sins that they had done in the previous year. The high priest first had to ask forgiveness for his own sin, and then for the sin of all the people. The high priest killed a lamb, and took the blood inside the temple. The furthest part of the temple was called the most holy place. The great day of forgiveness was the only time in a year that anyone was allowed to come to that place. The high priest used the blood of the lamb that he killed and spread this in the most holy place. The sins of the people had made God's holy temple unclean, and by spreading the blood, the temple became clean again. Because of the sacrifice of the lamb, it was again possible for God and people to have a relationship together.

Later in the New Testament, the writer of the book of Hebrews compares the work that Jesus did with the work of a high priest on the great day of forgiveness. Jesus made people clean\-just as a high priest made the people clean. Jesus made it possible for people and God to have a relationship again. But Jesus did not kill a lamb to do this: Jesus himself died. So Jesus was both the lamb, as well as the high priest! But Jesus did not need to ask forgiveness for his own sins first, because Jesus had never sinned. And instead of having to repeat this sacrifice year after year, Jesus did this once and for all, for all people who believe in him.

## holy (id: 280086)

God is **holy**\-this means God is completely good, completely pure, powerful, and majestic. It means that God is whole, complete, and unchangeable. But most of all, it means God is God!

Any place, person, or object that is dedicated to God is called holy. That means that the object or person is set apart for God's special purposes\-they are no longer "common" or "ordinary," and no longer used for common or ordinary purposes.

Any place where God is becomes holy. People, because they are sinful, cannot just come to God. God might kill them if they did! In the Old Testament, God had made it possible for the Israelites to come to him safely through the temple worship. If people followed the rules that God gave them about how they should approach him, they would be safe. The Israelites had to follow certain rituals to make them acceptable before God. This was called "purifying themselves," or "becoming clean." These rituals involved bathing, washing of clothes, and staying away from certain foods or activities. People also needed to offer sacrifices to God. These rules about being clean in order to worship God reminded the people that God was holy and totally different from themselves.

God had chosen the Israelites to be his holy people and to serve God's purposes. Therefore the Israelites had to be different from the other nations around them. In order to be holy they had to worship God in the right way. They also had to obey God's commandments, which included treating each other with love and justice.

Objects can also be holy. They become holy if they are used for the worship of God. An object that is made holy can only be used for the worship of God, and cannot be used for ordinary work.

In the New Testament, Jesus is called holy because he is God. Everything that is true about God is true about Jesus as well.

The Holy Spirit is called holy because it is the spirit of God.

When people begin to trust in Jesus and receive the Holy Spirit, they become holy as well. Just as God had called the Israelites to be a holy people, he now calls all his children to be holy people. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in their heart to change them to become more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy, or set apart for God's special purposes. This work of the Holy Spirit is called sanctification.

## Holy Spirit (id: 280222)

The **Holy Spirit** is the **Spirit of God**. Sometimes the Bible calls this the Spirit of God, the **Spirit of the Lord**, or sometimes just the **Spirit**.

The Spirit of God is the power that comes from God. This power creates, gives life, performs miracles, and changes people.

When the spirit of God comes over a person, that person receives a special power or ability. This can mean physical strength, special wisdom, or a clear understanding of what God wants. The Holy Spirit gave messages from God to the prophets, which the prophets then shared with the people.

The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in their heart to help them to behave more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy. This work of the Holy Spirit is called sanctification.

The Holy Spirit is not just a power, but is also a person itself. We know this for instance because the Bible says that it is possible to make the Holy Spirit sad. The Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity\-the God who is one, but consists of three persons. God the father, God the son Jesus, and God the Holy Spirit are three different persons, but together they are one God. We can see all three members of the Trinity together at Jesus's baptism, when the Holy Spirit comes down on Jesus and the voice of God speaks from heaven. The Bible does not use the word Trinity anywhere, but the church began to use this word several generations after Jesus had gone back to heaven to describe the mystery of God being both three and one.

In the language that the Bible was written in, the word for spirit is the same as the word for "wind" and "breath." We can understand why these words are similar: They are all invisible and therefore somewhat mysterious, but very important.

Sometimes it is not clear if, in a certain passage, the meaning is "spirit," or "wind," or "breath." The fact that the word can mean all these things adds beauty and depth to such a passage.

## Hosanna (id: 280147)

In the Old Testament, the word **Hosanna** means "save us." We can hear this word in Psalm 118\. In this Psalm, the singer asks God to save the people, and then begins to praise God. Because of that, by the time of the New Testament people used the word Hosanna as a way to praise God with great joy, because they trusted that God was going to save them soon. The practical meaning of the word Hosanna in the New Testament is therefore "praise God."

**When you are translating Hosanna, be careful about the following things:**

You can translate Hosanna as "praise God!" Be sure that you make clear to your listeners that the people who are praising God with this word are very happy and excited.

Some translators choose to make up a word in their own language that sounds like "Hosanna." If you want to do that, you may also want to say one time that this word means "praise God."

## House of David (id: 280152)

The **house of David** refers not to a building, but to the people who belong to David. David was an important king in Israel's history.

Sometimes the house of David means all the people who belonged to David at the time that David was alive. At one time, David was fighting with another king, king Saul. The Bible says at that time that "there was war between the house of David and the house of Saul." This means that the soldiers of David were fighting with the soldiers of king Saul.

At other times, the house of David means David's descendants. When David wanted to build a temple\-a house\-for God, God told him: "I don't need you to build a house for me. Instead, I will build a house for you!" This meant that God would give David many descendants, and that always one of them would be a king like David.

God told the people of Israel through his messengers, the prophets, that the Messiah, the special king and Savior, would come from the house of David. This meant that the Messiah would be a descendant from David.

## house of God (id: 280104)

The **house of God** is a way to talk about the place on earth where God lived among his people. Although God does not need to live in a house, God told the Israelites that he would live among them and meet with them in the special portable tent they prepared for him. The Israelites called this tent the tabernacle. Later, when the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, God gave them instructions for building a more permanent house for him\-the temple. People sometimes called both the tabernacle and the temple the "house of God." Today, God's Spirit lives in the hearts of the people who follow Jesus, and God meets with his people everywhere they are.

## household (id: 280151)

In the Bible, a **household** means all the people who are living together in one **house**. The father was usually the head of the household. The household included his wife, children, unmarried daughters, and any married sons and their wives and children. There might be other relatives living with them as well. If the family had servants or slaves, then they were included in the household as well.

People also used the word "house" instead of "household." If someone said "me and my house," they meant "me and all the people in my household."

People could also use the word household, or house, to mean a large group of people who did not live in the same house, but who had something in common. For instance, the Israelites are sometimes called the "house of Israel."

## hymn (id: 280156)

A **hymn** is a song of praise to God. Jewish people usually patterned them after the psalms. Jewish people sang praises of God when they met together in the synagogue.

## hypocrisy (id: 280174)

**Hypocrisy** means that someone pretends to be good, but is not really good. A person who tells people that it is important to do certain things, but who does not do them himself, is a hypocrite. A person who teaches other people about the law of God, but who breaks the law of God himself, is a hypocrite. Someone who thinks bad thoughts but who does good things only because he wants other people to praise him, is a hypocrite. A hypocrite is not sincere. He only wants to look good in the eyes of people, but he does not really care about obeying God.
