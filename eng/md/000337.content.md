## Sea of Galilee (id: 280209)

The **Sea of Galilee** is a sea, or a lake, in the north of Israel. In the New Testament, the part of the country near the Sea of Galilee is called Galilee.

A sea, or a lake, is a place where there is only water. A sea is usually bigger than a lake, but in the Bible the Sea of Galilee is sometimes called a sea, and sometimes called a lake.

The Sea of Galilee was about 20 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide. If you wanted to walk all around the lake, you would have to walk for one or two days. People often used boats to go from one side of the lake to another side. The middle of the lake was very deep. There were many fish in the lake, and most people who lived in the villages nearby the lake made a living by catching and selling fish. The water in the sea was fresh, which means that it was not salty, unlike the water in many other seas.
