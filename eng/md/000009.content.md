## altar (id: 341008)

An **altar** is a place where people make offerings or sacrifices to God. It is like a table or a platform that people make of earth or large stones. People placed gifts for God on this table. Often this meant that people then burned the gift. The gift could be an animal, or could be food items, or sweet smelling spices.

Before the Israelites built the tabernacle and the temple, the Israelites built altars in different places. After God had told them to make the tabernacle, the Israelites were only supposed to build altars in the tabernacle, and later in the temple.

Other people groups besides the Israelites also made altars to give offerings to their own gods.
