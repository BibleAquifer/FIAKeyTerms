## Herodian (id: 280200)

In the New Testament, the word **Herodians** means a group of people who supported the rule of the Herodian family\-which means king Herod, his son Herod and his grandson Herod. The Roman government had appointed these rulers, and so Herodians were also supportive of the Roman government. In this way they were the opposites of the Pharisees, the group of religious teachers who were against Roman rule. However, the Pharisees and the Herodians worked together against Jesus.
