## amen (id: 280100)

**Amen** is an Hebrew word. Depending on when it is used, it can mean something like, "I accept this," "May it be true," "Indeed," or "Truly."

When someone tells you that something good is going to happen, you can respond by saying "Amen!" This means that you say that you hope and believe that it will be true.

When someone offers a prayer to God, you can say "Amen." This means that you hope and believe that the prayer will be answered.

Jesus uses the word amen in a different way. Jesus often says "Amen" or even "Amen, amen" at the beginning of his teaching. When Jesus says "Amen," he means: "Listen carefully to what I'm going to say, because it is true and very important."
