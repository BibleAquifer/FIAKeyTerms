## el-elyon (id: 341031)

**El\-Elyon** is a name that people use for God. El\-Elyon means "the most high God." When people use this name for God, they are reminded that God is the most powerful of any being. The name means that there is no one who is more important, or has more authority, or has more power than God. People often use this name for God in the Psalms, but also in several other books in the Old Testament.

The word "el" means God, and therefore we find several other names for God in the Bible that begin with this word "el." Each of these names tells us something important about God.

Scholars are not sure what the name **El\-Shaddai** means exactly. El\-Shaddai is a name for God that probably means God Almighty or God All\-Powerful. Shaddai may mean "sufficient," so this name for God shows that God is all\-powerful and all\-sufficient for the needs of his people. This name for God is especially used in the book of Genesis.

## elder (id: 280060)

An **elder** is a person with authority in the community. In the Old Testament, an elder was usually the head of a family or a group of families. A group of elders would meet together to make decisions about the affairs in the community.

In the New Testament, elders are people in the church who have authority. The apostles, such as Paul, appointed the elders. The apostles chose people who were respected by the other people in the church community to become elders. An elder had to be willing to serve other people and had to be blameless.

**When you are translating elders, be careful about the following things:**

When you are translating this word, be careful that you do not use a word that just means "old people." An elder was not necessarily an old person, though they would not be a very young person either.

## Elijah (id: 280128)

**Elijah** was an important prophet who lived about 800 years before Jesus was born. A prophet is someone who gives messages from God to people.

Elijah lived during the time that Israel was ruled by kings who did not obey God, and these kings had led the people of Israel away from God. The people had begun to worship false gods, especially a god named Baal. People thought that this Baal was responsible for giving people rain. Therefore, Elijah told the king of Israel that it would no longer rain in Israel for as long as he said! And indeed, it did not rain for three years, and because of that a famine came over the whole land. After that, Elijah prayed and God sent rain again. This taught the people that *God* was the one who gave rain, not Baal!

Elijah performed several miracles during his life that are similar to miracles that Jesus would do many years later. Through Elijah, God provided a widow and her son miraculous food during the time of the famine. When the widow's son died, Elijah raised this child up from the dead.

At the end of his life, Elijah separated the water of the Jordan River with his cloak and walked across the water to the other side. This miracle resembled the miracles that Moses, as well as Joshua, had done hundreds of years before Elijah. There are more similarities between Elijah and Moses: For instance, both spoke with God on Mount Sinai. And in the New Testament Moses and Elijah appear together with Jesus on top of a mountain, a few weeks before Jesus's death.

Elijah did not die like other people do. God took Elijah up to heaven in a chariot, which is a small cart that is pulled by horses, with fire. Elijah's helper, who was named Elisha, became Elijah's successor.

In the book of the prophet Malachi, which was written hundreds of years after Elijah's life, God said to the people of Israel that before God would come back to judge the whole world, God would send the prophet Elijah. This means that God would send another prophet like Elijah. This new Elijah would make the people of Israel repent, so that they would be ready to receive God. Jesus later explains to his disciples that John the baptizer was the Elijah that Malachi talked about. This does not mean that John really was Elijah, but it means that John was someone like Elijah. John was doing the same task as the one that God had given to Elijah, to tell the people of Israel to repent.

## Elizabeth (id: 280215)

Elizabeth was the mother of John the baptizer. Elizabeth's husband was Zechariah. Zechariah was a priest and served God in the temple in Jerusalem. Elizabeth was unable to have children.

One time, when her husband Zechariah was in the temple, an angel appeared to Zechariah and told him that his wife Elizabeth would have a son. This son would be a servant of God like Elijah the prophet and would tell the people of Israel to repent in order to prepare the people to receive God. Zechariah could not believe that what the angel said was true, because Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth were already old. Because Zechariah did not believe the angel, the angel told Zechariah that he would be unable to speak until after the birth of the child.

Elizabeth indeed became pregnant. Elizabeth was a relative of Mary, who would become the mother of Jesus. Shortly after this, an angel appeared to Mary and told her that she would become pregnant even though she was a virgin. Her son would be a very important person, the son of God, and would rule as king forever. Mary then went to visit Elizabeth. When Mary came to Elizabeth, the baby in Elizabeth's womb jumped up in joy, because Mary would become the mother of the Messiah, the promised king and Savior.

## eternal life (id: 280125)

**Eternal life** means a life with God that will never end. Eternal life is the gift that God gives to his children if they believe in him. It is not something that people can get if they work hard enough, or if they perform enough rituals. When a person puts his trust in Jesus, God gives this gift to them.

Eternal life is a much better and richer life than ordinary life. Without this gift of eternal life, we may live and breathe, but this is only physical life, and it will end as soon as we die. But the eternal life that God gives us will never end! It begins now, changing us and making it possible for us to live in a close relationship with God. When Jesus will come back and establish his kingdom forever, we will also live with him forever. That is the gift from God: life in the future, and real life already now!

## evil (id: 280071)

**Evil** is the opposite of good.

A person who is evil willingly does bad things that hurt other people. When people stop obeying God they begin to do evil actions.

Because humans are so disobedient to God, the Bible teaches us that our hearts have become evil. Instead of wanting to do good things, we want to do bad things. Very many problems in the world like war, poverty, and injustice happen because of the evil inside people's hearts. Even sickness and death is ultimately a result of evil.

God hates evil. Only God can destroy evil, because God is all good. When God will establish his kingdom forever, he will destroy evil forever. Nothing that is evil will enter God's kingdom. Until that time, God still allows evil to happen. However, God is more powerful than all evil.

## evil spirit (id: 280180)

The phrases demon, **evil spirits**, or **unclean spirit** are referring to the same thing. A demon is a spirit that is rebelling against God. The leader of all demons is called Satan, the devil, or sometimes Beelzebul. Because God has created everything that exists, God also created these spirits. God created them good, as angels, to do his work. But some angels rebelled against God, and these became evil spirits. These evil spirits try to destroy and deceive people.

Demons can take control of people so that people become sick, or behave in a strange way. When a demon takes control of a person, we say that the person is demon possessed. A person who was possessed by a demon could become deaf, mute, or have fits that resemble epileptic attacks. The person could become very violent and shout. Jewish people tried to drive out demons from people through rituals that could last a long time. But Jesus drove out many demons from people during his time on earth, and he did this only by commanding the demons to leave!

Demons can also be called **evil spirits**. This makes clear that their intentions are evil. They sometimes are called unclean spirits. Something that is unclean is unfit for service to God.

**When you are translating demon, be careful about the following things:**

Demons are not the spirits of humans who have died, though in many cultures they may pretend that this is what they are. If you have to use a term that means spirits of dead people, then be aware that the people will have to learn over time that these spirits are not really spirits of dead people, but are only pretending to be so.
