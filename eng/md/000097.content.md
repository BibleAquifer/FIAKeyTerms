## divorce (id: 280067)

**Divorce** is a permanent and legal separation between a husband and wife. In the Old Testament, the law of God allowed a man to divorce his wife if he thought she had a relationship with another man. However, God makes clear that he hates divorce. God wants husband and wife to live together in harmony and to be dedicated to each other.

In the New Testament, Jesus also teaches the people that divorce is wrong. God meant for husband and wife to live together in unity.
