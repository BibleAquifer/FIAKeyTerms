## vineyard (id: 280172)

A **vineyard** is a garden where people grow grapes. Grapes are a soft, juicy fruit that grows on a tree called a grapevine. People eat grapes fresh, or dry them in the sun. Once they are dried out, they are called **raisins** and can be kept for a long time. People also extract the juice from grapes to make an alcoholic drink called **wine**. Grapes are very common in Israel, and wine\-usually diluted with water\-was a common drink.

A vineyard usually had a wall around it so that wild animals or thieves could not come into the garden. People made this wall out of rocks or thorny bushes. Inside the vineyard was a hut for the watchman. This hut was a bit higher than the rest of the garden so that the watchman could look out over the garden. This was called a watchtower.

There was also a winepress. A winepress is a flat piece of stone with a ledge around it. People pour the grapes on this stone and then they trample on the grapes with their feet. This would squeeze out the juice from the grapes. The juice would flow into a container called a wine vat. Another way of taking out the juice was by rolling a heavy stone over the grapes.

Vineyards were so common in Israel that we often find them in picture language. In the Old Testament, God sometimes compared the people of Israel with a vineyard, or with a vine tree. Jesus told several parables in which he used something related to a vine tree, a vineyard, or to wine, to explain something about the kingdom of God.

*You could look at the pictures of a vineyard in the video Bible dictionary.*

## vision (id: 280094)

If you have a vision, you are seeing something from God that other people do not see, or are hearing something from God that other people do not hear. God sometimes gives visions to people to tell them about something that will happen in the future, or to tell someone to do something. God can also show people something in a dream, when they are sleeping, but a vision is happening when a person is awake.

## vow (id: 341033)

A person who is making a **vow** is asking God to do something for them, and is offering to do something in return or to stop doing something. People can make vows to show that they are devoted to God. God does not require people to make vows. But, if a person makes a vow, the vow is seriously binding like an oath. God releases the person from the vow once he has done what he vowed to do.

Jacob asked God to bring him back to the land of his father, and if God would do this, then Jacob would worship God. Jacob was making a vow.

Hannah asked God to give her a son, and promised that if God would do so, Hannah would give the son back to God to serve him. Hannah was making a vow.
