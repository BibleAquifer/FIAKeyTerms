## glory (id: 280133)

**Glory** is the fame and admiration that you gain by doing something impressive.

When people *give* glory to God, they praise God, admire him, and say good things about God.

When God *shows* his glory, people can see how beautiful, powerful, and majestic God is. Not many people in the Bible have a chance to see the glory of God, so when it happens, this is a very special and impressive moment. It is so impressive that people usually become very afraid when they see the glory of God. Sometimes people see a very bright light at the same time, but not always.

It can be difficult to translate the word glory. In some cases, you can say "God's power and splendor." When you glorify God, you show God's power and splendor.
