## dream (id: 341013)

When you are sleeping but you experience some events that are not really happening, or you are seeing things that are not really there, you have a **dream**. God can use dreams to communicate to people. God can use dreams to tell people what will happen in the future, or to tell them something that they need to do.

A dream is different from a vision. A dream happens when you are asleep, but a vision happens when you are awake. When you have a vision, you see something or hear something that other people around you cannot see or hear, even though they might be right next to you. God also uses visions to communicate to people, just as he uses dreams.
