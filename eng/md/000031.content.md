## Bethsaida (id: 280098)

**Bethsaida** is a village in the province of Galilee. It was probably close to the city of Capernaum, because John tells us that Jesus's disciples Andrew and Peter came from Bethsaida, but Mark tells us that they lived in Capernaum. The village was close to the Sea of Galilee, and many people in the village made their living from fishing. The name Bethsaida even means "house of fishing."
