## elder (id: 280060)

An **elder** is a person with authority in the community. In the Old Testament, an elder was usually the head of a family or a group of families. A group of elders would meet together to make decisions about the affairs in the community.

In the New Testament, elders are people in the church who have authority. The apostles, such as Paul, appointed the elders. The apostles chose people who were respected by the other people in the church community to become elders. An elder had to be willing to serve other people and had to be blameless.

**When you are translating elders, be careful about the following things:**

When you are translating this word, be careful that you do not use a word that just means "old people." An elder was not necessarily an old person, though they would not be a very young person either.
