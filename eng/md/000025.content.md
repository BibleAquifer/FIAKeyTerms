## basket (id: 280193)

People use a **basket** to carry or store things. People make baskets by weaving together thin sticks, stems of plants, or reeds. A reed is a plant that grows in the water.

Some baskets were small and people carried them on their back. People used these baskets for carrying food. Other baskets were bigger, and two people might be needed to carry them when they were full. For example, fishermen used these baskets to collect the fish that they caught and to take it to the market.
