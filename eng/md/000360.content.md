## Son of God (id: 280148)

The **Son of God** is a title for Jesus. Jesus is called the son of God because he has a special relationship with God the Father. God and Jesus love each other in the way that a father and a son love each other. Sometimes Jesus is called "the *only* son of God." This means that the relationship that Jesus has with God is unique. Nobody else has this same relationship with God as Jesus has.

That Jesus is the son of God means that he himself is also God. Jesus is one person of the Trinity\-a word that the church is using to describe that God is *one*, but at the same time *three* persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Jesus has always been the Son of God, even before the beginning of our time, before the creation of the world. When Jesus came to earth, and was born, he also became a human.

When people in the New Testament call Jesus the Son of God, this is sometimes another way of saying that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ\-the promised king and Savior.

When people begin to trust in Jesus, God adopts them as children. Therefore, the Bible sometimes uses the phrase "*sons* of God" to describe the people who trust and follow Jesus.
