## Nazareth (id: 280196)

**Nazareth** is a small town in the region of Galilee, in the north of Israel. Nazareth does not appear in the Old Testament, and the first time we hear about this town is when we hear that Mary and Joseph, Jesus's parents, came from Nazareth. Jesus was born in a village called Bethlehem, in Judea, but when he was still small Mary and Joseph went to live in Nazareth. Therefore Jesus was later called a Nazarene, which means someone from Nazareth. That was not a compliment. The Jews from Judea looked down on the people in Galilee, and even the people within Galilee looked down on people from Nazareth, because it was a small and unimportant town.
