## bless (id: 280199)

When God **blesses** a person, God is doing, or promising to do, something good for that person.

When a human speaks a **blessing** over another person, they are praying that God will do good things for this other person.

When people are blessing God, it means they are worshiping God and thanking him for his goodness and his blessings.

When people are blessing something\-for instance food\-this means that they are thanking God for it.

When you call someone **blessed**, you mean to say that other people can congratulate that person. Other people can be glad for those people, because God has blessed them.

The opposite of a blessing is a curse. Through Moses, God told the Israelites that if they would obey God's commandments, God would bless them. But if they would disobey God, God would curse them. God will not protect those people who are cursed, and people who are cursed will not be in a good relationship with God.
