## foreigner (id: 341030)

A person is a **foreigner** in a country when they are in a country that is not where they were born. Strangers or sojourners are people who are foreigners in a country and temporarily live there, even though it is not where they were born. Abraham was a foreigner, or stranger, in Canaan. Later, when Abraham's descendants the Israelites made Canaan their own country, God gave them guidelines about how they should treat foreigners, and strangers or sojourners, who traveled through their country and who lived there among the Israelites.
