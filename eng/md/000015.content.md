## angel of the Lord (id: 341035)

An angel is a supernatural, spiritual being created by God. Angels give messages from God to people. The "angel of the Lord" or "angel of Yahweh" is a special angel who speaks with so much authority that it is as if God himself is speaking. Normally people would die if they saw God face to face, so it could even be that this angel is God himself, but appearing to people in a way that they can see Him and survive! People are often afraid when they see an angel of the Lord, because he usually looks awesome. We do not hear about this kind of angel of the Lord or angel of Yahweh in the New Testament, because he is no longer needed. God is now speaking directly through Jesus.
