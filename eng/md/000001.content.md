## abba (id: 280140)

**Abba** is the Aramaic word for "father." Aramaic was the language that the people in Israel spoke in Jesus's time. Jesus calls God "abba" when he prays to God just before he was arrested and then crucified. Paul later wrote in his letters that the Holy Spirit makes us say "abba, father!" to God. This means that because of the Holy Spirit, we can have the same intimate relationship with God as a child has with its father\-just as Jesus had.
