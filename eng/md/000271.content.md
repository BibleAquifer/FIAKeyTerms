## parable (id: 280047)

A **parable** is a story that has a deeper meaning. Jesus told many parables. In these stories, Jesus used characters and situations that were very familiar to the people around him. These stories often had an ending that was quite surprising to Jesus's listeners, and sometimes even shocking. Through the stories Jesus told the people things about God, and about how things work in the kingdom of God. By telling these stories, Jesus wanted the people to change their thinking and their behavior. People needed to listen very carefully to the parables to understand them. Only people who trusted in Jesus could really understand these parables. For other people, parables were just stories that did not mean anything. Sometimes Jesus explained the meaning of the parable to his disciples in private.

In the Old Testament, the prophets\-the people who gave messages from God to the people\-also sometimes told parables to teach the people something about God.
