## law (id: 280072)

When in the Bible people talk about the **law**, they mean the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. In the Old Testament, God gave the people his laws through a man named Moses. God spoke with Moses, and Moses told the people what God said. Therefore, people often say the **law of Moses** when they mean the law that God gave the people through Moses.

A law is a rule, or a set of rules that people have to keep. The original term we translate "law" in the Bible is a term that people can use in legal settings when someone breaks a law of a country. If someone does not keep a rule, we say that he breaks the law. God told the people through Moses that if people would keep God's law, God would bless them. But if people would break God's law, God would punish them. God gave these laws because only by obeying these rules can people live in a right relationship with God, and with each other.

A summary of the law of God are the 10 commandments. From these 10 rules we learn how to behave towards God, and how to behave towards each other. Jesus summarized the law even further: He said, "Love God with your whole heart, and love other people as much as you love yourself." These are the most important commandments.

In the Old Testament, we find the law of God especially in the first five books of the Bible. Therefore, the Jews called these books together "the law," even though not everything that is in these books has to do with law. Sometimes when the Jews talked about "the law," they even meant *all* the books of the Scriptures, which is the part of the Bible that we now call the Old Testament.

So, when a Jewish person was talking about "the law," they might be talking about the law that God has given to the people through Moses, or they might be talking about the first five books of the Bible, or they might be talking about the whole Old Testament.
