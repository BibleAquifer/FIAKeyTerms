## anoint (id: 280131)

To **anoint** someone means to pour sweet smelling oil over someone. You can also anoint an object.

In the Old Testament, before God gave someone a special task, he would instruct someone else to pour oil over that person's head. The oil was a symbol for the Holy Spirit of God. This ritual made clear that God had set this person apart for a special purpose. It also made clear that God was giving this person special authority. The person was then called "anointed." For instance, God told Samuel to anoint David as king of Israel. God told Moses to anoint Aaron as high priest. And God told the prophet Elijah to anoint Elisha as a prophet to succeed Elijah.

Later, the word "anointed" was also used for people whom God had appointed for a special task, even if there had not been a ritual that involved the pouring of oil. Jesus is called "the anointed," because God has selected him for a very special task.

People could also anoint objects. The priests anointed the objects that were used in the temple with oil to make clear that they now had a special purpose. These objects now belonged to God; they were sacred.

Jewish people also used anointing as a daily activity that had no special meaning. They used sweet smelling oil to take care of their skin and their hair. Jesus told the people that if they fasted, they should anoint themselves just as they did every day, rather than make themselves look unkempt so that other people could think, "These people are fasting, how impressive!"

People also put some oil on guests to show them they were welcome and honored. There are two stories in the Gospels of women putting oil on Jesus's feet to honor him.

Jewish people also anointed a person's body after his death. After Jesus died, the women are bringing sweet smelling oil to the tomb in order to anoint Jesus's body.

In the New Testament, the early Christians sometimes used oil together with prayer if someone was sick. The apostle James, in his letter, says that if someone is sick, the other believers should pray for the person and anoint the person with oil. This was not because the oil had any special power, but because it was a symbol of God's presence.
