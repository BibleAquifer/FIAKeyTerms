## hypocrisy (id: 280174)

**Hypocrisy** means that someone pretends to be good, but is not really good. A person who tells people that it is important to do certain things, but who does not do them himself, is a hypocrite. A person who teaches other people about the law of God, but who breaks the law of God himself, is a hypocrite. Someone who thinks bad thoughts but who does good things only because he wants other people to praise him, is a hypocrite. A hypocrite is not sincere. He only wants to look good in the eyes of people, but he does not really care about obeying God.
