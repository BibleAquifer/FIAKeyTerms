## synagogue (id: 280124)

A **synagogue** is a place where Jewish people are meeting for prayer and for study of the Scriptures, as well as for other types of discussion and teaching.

A synagogue is different from the temple. The temple was the place where people brought sacrifices to God. People did not bring sacrifices in the synagogue. There was only one temple for the Jews, in Jerusalem, but there were many synagogues. We do not hear about synagogues in the Old Testament, but in the time of the New Testament there were many synagogues throughout Israel, as well as in many other countries where Jewish people lived.

The Jews gathered in the synagogues on the Sabbath\-the weekly day of rest\-and on special feast days. During their gatherings they prayed together, read from the Scriptures, the books of the Bible that we now call the Old Testament, and listened to teaching about the Scriptures.

Each synagogue had a ruler who was responsible for the building and for making sure that everything was done properly. The ruler of the synagogue was in charge of inviting people to come forward to pray, to read from the Scriptures, or to teach.

The Scriptures were written on scrolls\-long strips of material made from the fiber of certain plants or from the skin of animals\-that were rolled up. These scrolls were kept in boxes inside the synagogue. Scrolls were precious. A special person was in charge of taking out a scroll from the box and giving it to the person who was going to read.

The synagogue was also used as a school for children, and as a meeting place for people to discuss issues within their community.

**When you are translating "synagogue," be careful about the following things:**

You should not use the same word as you are using for the temple. You should also not use the same word as you are using for a church building. You could maybe use a phrase like "Jewish meeting house," or "prayer house."
