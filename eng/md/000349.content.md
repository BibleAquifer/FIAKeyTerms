## sign (id: 280169)

A **sign** is something unusual that is happening for a special reason. God can give a sign to tell people that something he tells them is true. For instance, when God promised Noah that he would never again destroy the earth through water, he placed the rainbow in the sky as a sign. Every time people would see the rainbow, they could remember God's promise.

Sometimes God would give a sign as a warning that something important was going to happen. For instance, God told the priest Eli that both Eli's sons would die on the same day. This would be a sign that everything that God had said that would happen to the Israelites as a punishment for their sins would become true.

Jesus performed many miracles. These miracles were signs that showed the people that Jesus really was sent by God, and that people should listen to what Jesus was saying about God.

Jesus's believers also performed miracles. These were signs that proved that Jesus's believers were speaking the truth about Jesus.

Because a sign is very similar to a miracle, we often hear the phrase in the Bible "signs and miracles" or "signs and wonders."

Signs are helping people to believe, but we have to trust God even when he does not give any sign. If people only trust God when they see signs, they do not really trust God at all. Therefore Jesus refused to perform a sign for people when they asked him to do so.

Even when God does do a sign, only people who are willing to believe him will believe in the sign. Other people will say that the sign is not true or did not come from God.
