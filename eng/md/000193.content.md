## house of God (id: 280104)

The **house of God** is a way to talk about the place on earth where God lived among his people. Although God does not need to live in a house, God told the Israelites that he would live among them and meet with them in the special portable tent they prepared for him. The Israelites called this tent the tabernacle. Later, when the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, God gave them instructions for building a more permanent house for him\-the temple. People sometimes called both the tabernacle and the temple the "house of God." Today, God's Spirit lives in the hearts of the people who follow Jesus, and God meets with his people everywhere they are.
