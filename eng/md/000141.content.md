## Gabriel (id: 280090)

Gabriel is the name of an archangel. An archangel is an angel with special authority. The Bible mentions two archangels by name: Gabriel and **Michael**. In the Old Testament, Gabriel explains to **Daniel** the meaning of Daniel's visions. In the New Testament, Gabriel appears to Zechariah to tell him that his wife will give birth to a son, even though she is already old. This child would become John the baptizer. Shortly after this, Gabriel appears to the virgin Mary and tells her that she will become pregnant by the power of God. The son that she will bear will be king forever, and he will be the son of God.
