## pray (id: 280177)

When you **pray**, or offer a **prayer**, you are communicating with God. You might be praising him, thanking him, asking him for help, telling him about the wrong things you have done, asking him to help other people, or you might just be crying to him because you feel so sad. In the Bible, all these things are part of praying.

Sometimes people speak out loud when they pray, and sometimes they only pray with their thoughts. We might call this "praying in your heart." Sometimes people kneel down to pray, and sometimes they stand up, with their arms stretched up to God. There are no rules in the Bible about how you should pray, only that you have to pray sincerely and humbly.

Sometimes people can pray all together at the same time. Many of the Psalms in the Bible are prayers, and the Israelites would recite or sing these prayers when they came together to worship God in the temple.

When God listens to someone's prayer and responds in some way, we say that God has answered this person's prayer.

**When you are translating prayer, be careful about the following things:**

Some languages use a word for prayer that means the speaking of certain, fixed words. This would not be a good word to use for prayer in the Bible.

Some languages have more than one word for praying, depending on what kind of conversation people are having with God. For example, some languages have one word for thanksgiving prayers and another word for prayer that is asking God for help. Be sure you are using the right word in each context. Maybe you need to use more than one word for prayer in a passage.
