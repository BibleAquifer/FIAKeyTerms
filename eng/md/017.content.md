## rabbi (id: 280089)

**Rabbi** is a name that people in Israel gave a religious teacher. In their language the word means "my great one," or "my great teacher." When someone calls another person "Rabbi," they are giving that person respect. Some translations keep the word "Rabbi," and other translations just say "teacher."

**When you are translating Rabbi, be careful about the following things:**

You can use a word or phrase in your language that means "teacher." But the word should not be a word that is only used for a teacher of children in a school.

## ransom (id: 280190)

When someone is a prisoner, or a slave, another person can buy that person free. The money that the person pays to free the prisoner or the slave is called a **ransom**.

The Bible says that Jesus gave his life as a ransom for people. This means that people are like prisoners or slaves, and that Jesus paid something to free the people. Jesus did not buy the people free with money, but with his own life, which is much more precious. Jesus's death was the price that Jesus paid to free the people from sin and shame and death.

## redeem (id: 280160)

The Bible uses earthly words to talk about heavenly things. Earthly words and heavenly things do not fit together perfectly, but they give us a helpful picture of God and what God does.

The Bible has several helpful ways of talking about how God **redeems**, or frees, his people.

Slaves must serve their masters. People who have debts must pay their debts. When you are redeeming a person, you are freeing that person from debt or slavery. This could involve paying a person's debt. The person who is freed is redeemed. Usually people redeem relatives or others they know. Sometimes a kind person who has enough money might redeem a stranger they feel sorry for.

Another example of redemption is that of a poor family who must sell their land for some reason. God had made a rule that land in Israel should always stay within the family. If a family was so poor that they had to sell a part of their land, then a relative should buy it from them if possible. That way, the land stayed in the family. We say that the relative "redeemed" the land. Sometimes a relative did not or could not buy or redeem the land. However, God had made a rule that in every 50th year\-called the year of Jubilee\-all the land had to go back to the original owners! That way, God made sure that no one would ever become too poor.

The Bible uses the picture of buying someone free to describe what God has done for people. In the Old Testament, God freed the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt. God did not pay the Egyptians anything in order to free the Israelites; God freed the Israelites because God is powerful and mighty. God described what he did for Israel by saying that He redeemed the people of Israel.

In the New Testament, we learn that God has redeemed us, or freed us, from slavery to sin. The idea of redemption, or God redeeming us, shows us what God has done. However, we should remember that God did not pay anyone anything for us. God does not need to pay someone something; he is powerful and mighty enough to save us. But God offered his son in our place, like one offers payment, to make us free from slavery to sin and evil. It is like God paid a very costly price for this: his own life, the life of Jesus. Because of this costly price, people can be free. God has redeemed us. We have received redemption. Redemption is a wonderful word that helps us understand God and what He has done when God redeemed us, or made us free.

## repentance (id: 280176)

When you **repent**, you feel sorry about the bad things that you have done and you want to change. It is as if you are turning around: You turn away from the bad things, and you start walking towards good things. You are now determined to obey God instead of disobeying God.

God tells the people that they have to repent of their sins. When people repent, God forgives them and does not punish them for the bad things they have done. But if people do not repent, God will punish them.

Sometimes the Bible even tells us that God repents. Of course, God cannot sin and does not need to repent of something bad he has done. When the Bible says that God repents, it means that God changes his mind about something.

**When you are translating to repent, or repentance, be careful about the following things:**

The word that you are choosing should not just mean that someone feels sorry for what they have done. It should be clear that the person who repents also wants to stop doing bad things and wants to start obeying God. Maybe you need a phrase instead of just one word.

Here is one way you could help explain repentance:

Draw or line out a path. One end of the path ends in a very dangerous place\-a fireplace, or a cliff, or anything that is dangerous. The other end of the path ends in a good place\-maybe a table with food, or a nice garden, or any object that helps people to see that this is a good place.

Then have some people walk on this path towards the dangerous place. Act out these people doing bad things on the way\-maybe like hitting each other, or stealing. Then have someone else come to them, and tell them that they should repent.

Act out that some of the people walking on the road realize the bad things that they have done, and they notice the dangerous place that they are walking towards. Act out that they are feeling really bad! Then act out that these people turn around, and begin to walk towards the good end of the road. They can act out doing good things now.

Maybe one of the people in your drama can *not* repent and end up in the fire or over the edge of the cliff.

## resurrection (id: 280068)

After Jesus died, he became alive again after three days. We say that he was **resurrected**. The event in which Jesus became alive again is called the **resurrection**. Jesus became alive again as a whole person\-with a body! He was not just a spirit, because people could touch Jesus. Jesus also ate with his disciples.

When Jesus will return to rule as king forever, the people whom God has accepted will become alive again and receive a new body\-a body that will never die again! This event is called the resurrection of the believers. Because Jesus became alive again, we can be sure that God will also make us alive again.

## righteousness (id: 280058)

Someone who is **righteous** is behaving in the right way. God is righteous, because everything that God does is right and good.

God wants all people to be righteous. Only a righteous person can have a good relationship with God.

The person who wants to obey God and wants to do things that pleases God is righteous, even though they may still make mistakes and unintentionally disobey God. A righteous person is sad when they discover that they have disobeyed God, and they repent. An unrighteous person on the other hand keeps doing bad things, and does not believe or care that God might get angry or punish them.

When Abraham believed the promise that God gave him that Abraham would have many descendants, God considered Abraham righteous. Abraham was not righteous because he had done a good thing, but simply because he trusted God.

This same kind of righteousness is available for people who believe in Jesus. When people trust in Jesus, God gives them the gift of righteousness. When you believe that you can have a right relationship with God because of what Jesus has done for you, God declares that you are righteous.

**When you are translating righteousness, be careful about the following things:**

You may describe righteousness as being in a right relationship with God, being right in God's sight, or being accepted by God. Or you may describe righteousness as being blameless or innocent, or being blameless or innocent in God's sight.

Your language may have special words that describe the idea of righteousness, such as "having a straight heart," "being upright," "walking in God's path," or other things like that.

*You may ask the people in the group to act out in pairs, without using the word righteous, what righteousness means. Afterwards, discuss what you have seen and talk about whether the dramas were accurately explaining what righteousness means in the Bible. This activity can help you to find a way to explain righteousness in your translation.*

## robe (id: 280192)

A **cloak**, also called a **robe**, is a piece of clothing. People wear a cloak on top of other clothes. A cloak helps to keep people warm and dry and can be used as a blanket at night. People made cloaks from animal skin or wool, which is the hair of an animal named a sheep. A cloak was often a simple square piece of material with holes for the arms.

*You can look in the visual Bible dictionary for a picture of a cloak.*
