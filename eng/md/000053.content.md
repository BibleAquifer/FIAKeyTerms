## Capernaum (id: 280138)

**Capernaum** was a small town in the region called Galilee, near the Sea of Galilee. Many people in Capernaum made their living from fishing or from buying and selling goods. The town was near an important road. People travelled on this road to other places to buy and sell goods. Therefore, the town was important in the region, even though it was not very large.

Several of Jesus's disciples came from Capernaum. Jesus often stayed in Capernaum.
