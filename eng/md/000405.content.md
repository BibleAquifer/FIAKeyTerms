## winepress (id: 280050)

A **winepress** is a flat piece of stone with a ledge around it. People in Israel use this to press the juice out of grapes. Grapes are a soft, juicy fruit. People pour the grapes on this stone and then they trample on the grapes with their feet. This would squeeze out the juice from the grapes. The juice would flow into a container called a wine vat. Another way of taking out the juice was by rolling a heavy stone over the grapes.

*You could look at pictures of a winepress in the video Bible dictionary.*
