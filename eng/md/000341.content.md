## servant (id: 280062)

In the Bible you can often use the same words for either a **servant** or a slave. A servant, or a **slave**, is a man or a woman who works for another person. A servant may live in the same house as their master in order to serve the family. A servant can work in the house, or can work on the fields of the master. If you are a servant, you usually have a low position in the community. Most servants did not have a choice about serving the master's family, so they are like slaves. In the New Testament, sometimes a different word for "servant" is used to show that this person serves others, but is not a slave.
