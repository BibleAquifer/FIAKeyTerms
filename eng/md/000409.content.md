## Word (id: 280157)

In the Bible, **word** usually means **the word of God**. The word of God means everything that God tells people. God speaks to the people either directly, or through people called prophets. God also speaks through his actions: When people see what God is doing, people can understand what he speaks to them.

When people in the New Testament talk about "the word," or "the word of God," or "the word of the Lord," they usually mean the good news that Jesus has come into the world.

People can know what God tells them through the Scriptures\-the Bible. Therefore, people also call the Scriptures "the word of God."
