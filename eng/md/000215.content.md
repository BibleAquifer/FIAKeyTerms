## Jerusalem (id: 280103)

**Jerusalem** is the name of the most important city of the Jewish people. The temple of God, where the Jews worshiped God, was in Jerusalem. The Jews traveled to Jerusalem several times a year to celebrate important festivals in the temple. The Jewish religious court, the Sanhedrin, also gathered in Jerusalem.

About a thousand years before Jesus was born, king David established the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. About 500 years later, the enemies of the Israelites destroyed the city, but the Israelites built it up again. The Jewish people loved the city of Jerusalem very much.

Jerusalem was part of the province called Judea. Jerusalem was built on a hill. Therefore people always said they were going "*up* to Jerusalem."
