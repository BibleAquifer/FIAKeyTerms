## burnt offering (id: 280198)

In the Old Testament, a **burnt offering** is a form of sacrifice that people bring to God. When a person brings God a burnt offering, he kills an animal and burns this animal completely on an altar, which is a special place meant for bringing gifts to God. When a person brings God a burnt offering, they are saying to God: "Just as I am completely burning this animal, I am completely devoted to you."
