## holy (id: 280086)

God is **holy**\-this means God is completely good, completely pure, powerful, and majestic. It means that God is whole, complete, and unchangeable. But most of all, it means God is God!

Any place, person, or object that is dedicated to God is called holy. That means that the object or person is set apart for God's special purposes\-they are no longer "common" or "ordinary," and no longer used for common or ordinary purposes.

Any place where God is becomes holy. People, because they are sinful, cannot just come to God. God might kill them if they did! In the Old Testament, God had made it possible for the Israelites to come to him safely through the temple worship. If people followed the rules that God gave them about how they should approach him, they would be safe. The Israelites had to follow certain rituals to make them acceptable before God. This was called "purifying themselves," or "becoming clean." These rituals involved bathing, washing of clothes, and staying away from certain foods or activities. People also needed to offer sacrifices to God. These rules about being clean in order to worship God reminded the people that God was holy and totally different from themselves.

God had chosen the Israelites to be his holy people and to serve God's purposes. Therefore the Israelites had to be different from the other nations around them. In order to be holy they had to worship God in the right way. They also had to obey God's commandments, which included treating each other with love and justice.

Objects can also be holy. They become holy if they are used for the worship of God. An object that is made holy can only be used for the worship of God, and cannot be used for ordinary work.

In the New Testament, Jesus is called holy because he is God. Everything that is true about God is true about Jesus as well.

The Holy Spirit is called holy because it is the spirit of God.

When people begin to trust in Jesus and receive the Holy Spirit, they become holy as well. Just as God had called the Israelites to be a holy people, he now calls all his children to be holy people. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in their heart to change them to become more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy, or set apart for God's special purposes. This work of the Holy Spirit is called sanctification.
