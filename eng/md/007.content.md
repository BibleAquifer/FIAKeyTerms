## Gabriel (id: 280090)

Gabriel is the name of an archangel. An archangel is an angel with special authority. The Bible mentions two archangels by name: Gabriel and **Michael**. In the Old Testament, Gabriel explains to **Daniel** the meaning of Daniel's visions. In the New Testament, Gabriel appears to Zechariah to tell him that his wife will give birth to a son, even though she is already old. This child would become John the baptizer. Shortly after this, Gabriel appears to the virgin Mary and tells her that she will become pregnant by the power of God. The son that she will bear will be king forever, and he will be the son of God.

## Galilee (id: 280088)

**Galilee** is the name of a region in northern Israel. Jesus grew up in Galilee and did much of his work of preaching in Galilee. Most of Jesus's disciples came from Galilee. Most parts of Galilee are hilly, with low mountains. To the east, or right, of Galilee is a large lake that is called the Sea of Galilee. Many people in Galilee made their living from fishing or selling fish. Some of Jesus's disciples were fishermen who lived in villages surrounding the Sea of Galilee. Other names for the Sea of Galilee are the **Sea of Gennesareth**, or the **Lake of Tiberius**.

In the time of Jesus, Israel was not an independent nation. The Israelites were ruled by the Roman people. The Romans had divided Israel into several regions, or provinces. During Jesus's life, Galilee was governed by a ruler named Antipas, who was appointed by the Roman government. Antipas was the son of king Herod, who tried to kill Jesus when he was a baby. Antipas was the brother of the Herod who ordered Jesus to be crucified.

Other provinces in Israel were Judea and Samaria. Galilee was in the north, Judea was in the south, and Samaria was in the middle. Judea was the place where the most important city, Jerusalem, was, and therefore the temple of God. The people in Judea often thought that they were better Jews than the people in Galilee. They looked down on the people in Galilee, and thought that people in Galilee were uneducated and rough. The people in Judea and as well, the people in Galilee, looked down on people in Samaria, whom they considered not to be Jews at all.

## generations (id: 280218)

A **generation** refers to a group of people who are living at the same time and belong to about the same age group. In a community, three generations of people can be living at the same time: grandparents, parents, and children. Each of these people belong to a different generation.

Sometimes God, or Jesus, talks about "the people of this generation." This means all the people who are alive at that particular time.

In the Old Testament, the phrase "these are the generations of this person..." is used to introduce a series of stories about this person. In this case, it means something like "this is the history of this person."

## Gentile (id: 280119)

The word **Gentile** comes from a word that means "people" or "nations."

In the Old Testament, God had chosen the Israelites to be his special people. The Israelites had to remain separate from people from other nations in order for the Israelites to remain devoted to God. They should not start to worship the idols from the other nations and follow their bad habits. However, when God had made his covenant with Abraham, the first ancestor of the Israelites, God had also said that through Abraham's descendants *all* the people of the world would be blessed. So, God cared about all people, not only about the Israelites, who were also called Jews.

Over time, the Israelites became proud of their special position and looked down on people who were not Jews. The word Gentile began to mean something negative\-a bad person, someone that you should stay away from. In the time of Jesus, the Romans were ruling the country of Israel. Therefore, many people who were not Jews were also living in Israel. All these people were called Gentiles. The Jews had to cooperate somewhat with the Gentiles, but they were not friendly with them. The Jews strictly forbade Gentiles to enter the temple area, and Jews would never eat together with Gentiles or go inside the home of a Gentile. The Jews believed that interacting with Gentiles would make them "unclean"\-or unfit for worship to God.

Sometimes instead of the word Gentile, we find the word "Greek." A Greek is a person who belongs to the country of Greece, but over time this word began to mean any person who adopted Greek culture. A good Jew would not adopt Greek culture, which involved idol worship. The word Greek therefore also began to be used for any person who was not a Jew, even if the person did not come from Greece. And so, the word "Greek" and "Gentile" can sometimes mean the same thing.

## glorify (id: 280070)

Glory is the fame and admiration that you gain by doing something impressive.

When people *give* glory to God they praise God, admire him, and say good things about God.

When God *shows* his glory, people can see how beautiful, powerful, and majestic God is. Not many people in the Bible have a chance to see the glory of God, so when it happens, this is a very special and impressive moment. It is so impressive that people usually become very afraid when they see the glory of God. Sometimes people see a very bright light at the same time, but not always.

It can be difficult to translate the word glory. In some cases, you can say "God's power and splendor." When you glorify God, you show God's power and splendor.

## God (id: 341032)

In the Bible, **God** refers to God who created everything. God is the most powerful spiritual being. This is the God who made a covenant, a special promise, to Abraham and his descendants, the Israelites. This is the God who sent his son Jesus to earth in order to save people through his death and resurrection.

God has always existed, and he will always exist. Because God created everything, he has power over everything. God is good and loving, powerful, and just.

When you are translating God, be careful about the following things: Some communities worship many different spiritual beings. In some cases, the name that people use for the most powerful spiritual being could be used for God. However, you need to check that this spiritual being does not have any characteristics that are contrary to the God of the Bible.

## good news (id: 280158)

The word **gospel** is a translation of a Greek word that literally means "good news." The **good news** in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. In the New Testament, it becomes clear that the way that God saves his people is through Jesus's death and resurrection. In Acts and in the epistles, when people are "preaching the gospel," they are telling the people the good news that they can be saved if they trust in Jesus.

In the part of the Bible that talks about Jesus's life\-the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John\-we also sometimes hear about the gospel, or about the "good news of the kingdom." At that time, Jesus had not yet died to save the people. The good news here means that the kingdom of God is about to begin, or has already begun. Jesus told the people that God was ruling over all the earth, and that soon God would establish his kingdom forever. Until that time, people should already behave as citizens of this kingdom, and prepare themselves to receive God. The good news is that God is ruling, and that even now we can already be members of his kingdom! After Jesus died to save us, people who trust in Jesus can be part of God's kingdom.

In the church, we often use the term "the Gospels" to talk about the four books of the New Testament that tell us about the life of Jesus: the books Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. When talking about just one of these books, we often say "the Gospel of Matthew," or "the Gospel of Mark." This means that when we say for example "the Gospel of Matthew," we mean the whole book of Matthew.

## grace (id: 280116)

When someone shows us grace, they do something good for us, or give us something good that we do not deserve.

God shows grace to people when he forgives them for their sins, and makes them his children. People deserve to be separated from God because of their disobedience, but God loves people so much that he wants to forgive them. Therefore, God does something good to the people that they do not deserve: He forgives them. This is grace.

Sometimes grace means something good that God has done for a particular person or something good that he has given to them. For instance, Paul says that God gave Paul *grace* to become an apostle. Paul did not deserve to become an apostle, but still God made him an apostle. God showed him grace.

## greeks (id: 341026)

People who belong to the country called Greece are **Greeks**. Greece is the country that is in the southern part of the area that we now call Europe. Several hundreds of years before the birth of Christ, Greece was the most powerful nation in the area, and the Greeks were ruling over a very large territory. This territory also included Israel.

The Greek culture had a lot of influence on other countries. Many people adopted Greek customs and began to speak the Greek language. Some people even worshiped Greek gods. During that time, even many Jews began to accept Greek gods. This led to a period of war in Israel where people who wanted to stay faithful to God were fighting against the Greek customs, and against the people who had accepted the Greek gods.

Over time, people who were following the Greek customs were called Greeks even when they did not come from the country of Greece.

During the time of the New Testament, the Greeks had lost their political powers and now the Romans were in power over the same part of the world. However, most people still spoke the Greek language. Many people in Israel spoke their own language called Aramaic, but they also spoke Greek. The authors of the books of the New Testament wrote in the Greek language.

In the New Testament, the term Greek can therefore refer to people who belonged to the country of Greece, or it can refer to people who had adopted the Greek culture and language. A good Jew would not adopt Greek culture, which involved idol worship, and therefore the word Greek began to be used in the meaning of "any person who is not a Jew." In that sense, sometimes the word "Greek" can mean the same as the word Gentile.
