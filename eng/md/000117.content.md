## el-shaddai (id: 341022)

Scholars are not sure what the name **El\-Shaddai** means exactly. El\-Shaddai is a name for God that probably means God Almighty or God All\-Powerful. Shaddai may mean "sufficient," so this name for God shows that God is all\-powerful and all\-sufficient for the needs of his people. This name for God is especially used in the book of Genesis.

The word "el" means God, and therefore we find several other names for God in the Bible that begin with this word. Each of these names tells us something important about God.
