## el-elyon (id: 341031)

**El\-Elyon** is a name that people use for God. El\-Elyon means "the most high God." When people use this name for God, they are reminded that God is the most powerful of any being. The name means that there is no one who is more important, or has more authority, or has more power than God. People often use this name for God in the Psalms, but also in several other books in the Old Testament.

The word "el" means God, and therefore we find several other names for God in the Bible that begin with this word "el." Each of these names tells us something important about God.
